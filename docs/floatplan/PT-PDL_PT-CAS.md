## FLOAT PLAN

Kai, Emily, and Reverie are sailing from the Azores to mainland Portugal. We will most likely be stoping to anchor outside a town called Cascais. It's just outside the capital Lisbon. There's an easy train into the big city.

The weather outlook for our roughly one-week passage from the Azores to the Lisbon area is light winds. We will be motoring most of the way. Since we're motoring we'll basically point to the destination and head just north of east. We might drift slightly north (39N) towards the middle of the passage. We are departing at the same time as our friends on [Sargo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wn6Uj1R5-jnejQhPvTnCNHbyFAF5VMI1dftjm7RNim4).

### DESCRIPTION

Twig is a 2001 Saga 43 fiberglass (FRP) monohull sailboat. Single mast, sloop rigged with two headsails right next to one another in a solent configuration. The hull is cream colored. Green sail bag and cockpit canvas. Fin keel, spade rudder, light green bottom paint.

* **Length:** 43 ft (13.1m)
* **Breadth:** 11.9 ft (3.6m)
* **Draft:** 6.9 ft (2.1m)

### DEPARTURE

* **Port:** PT PDL (Portugal, Ponta Delgada, Azores)
* **Date:** 2021-08-21 11:00 UTC
* **Coords:** 37 44N 025 40W

### DESTINATION

* **Port:** PT CAS (Portugal, Cascais)
* **Date:** 2021-08-27 16:00 UTC
* **Coords:** 38 42N 009 25W

### ROUTE

We will sail east between 32N 33N until 060W before deciding when to begin moving north. If it looks like there is a strong weather front around the 16th to 18th to the north of our position we will might remain below 34N until 039W. The absolute furthest north we expect to be is 39N, probably between 041W and 034W. Waypoint updates with ETA for the waypoint will be made via our twitter (@TwigVessel) feed that is available on the [Position & Updates](https://www.sailingthebakery.com/location) page listed above. For example “#waypoint 33 00N 060 00W ETA 2021-06-15 0300UTC”. The coordinates are shorthand for 33 Degrees 0 Minutes North 060 Degrees 0 Minutes West. The time is given in 24 hour format in Coordinated Universal Time so 0300UTC is 3:00AM.

### TRACKING - LATEST POSITION

We transmit our position using two methods. One is over VHF with a Class A Automatic Identification System (AIS) transceiver. The other is via the Iridium satellite network using a device called the Iridium GO!

AIS transmits our details (name, position, speed, direction, destiation) to other vessels within a 20 mile radius. It’s also received by various shore stations and satellite receivers that relay our position to websites like MarineTraffic when they receive our location info. Positions sent by shore stations work when we are as far as 80 miles from shore. AIS position reports are also available over satellite but require purchase. If we stop updating for some reason it is possible to purchase 24 hours of SAT-AIS updates from MarineTraffic for $1 using the mobile app. AIS works globally and position reports are available to various MRCCs.

When on passage we send our position via Iridium to https://www.noforeignland.com/boat/twig/journey and https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/shipid:450795/tracktype:9/lpt:1606661280 Normally Marine Traffic only deals with AIS but they allow us to report our position using other methods when offshore. Our satellite updates _are not guaranteed_ but attempted every 5-10 minutes. Note that there are sometimes spans of several hours or more where our position is not updated. The Irdium GO! is unreliable and can crash and fail to restart.

Our latest position from our Iridium device can be obtained by texting the word twig to +1 763-878-8944. You should get an automatic reply within a couple minutes. It includes coordinates and the time of the fix in UTC. For example example, sending the word twig will result in a message that looks like "Twig - 32 22.783 N - 64 40.377 W - 2021-06-10 18:53UTC - 0.1 SOG - 145 COG". Speed Over Ground (SOG) and Course Over Ground (COG) are simple calculations based on the previous position and time. The same method can be used to retrieve the position of one of our buddy boats by texting their vessel name (sargo, taima1, polarseal) to the same number.

A **low-bandwidth friendly** webpage with positions for [Twig](https://api.wayoffthegrid.com/position/twig) and our buddy boats is available at https://api.wayoffthegrid.com/position or for Twig specifically https://api.wayoffthegrid.com/position/twig

If our position hasn't updated at any of the above links and we have not communicated with Emergency Contacts listed below in over 12-24 hours it's possible to get our position by purchasing access to AIS SAT Data https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/online-services/single-services/sat-flexible (MMSI 367572690) by contacting our weather router listed below or by contacting a Maritime Rescue Coordination Center (MRCC).

### COMMUNICATIONS

**We love getting messages at sea.** If you’d like to send us a short message from a US phone, use +1 763-878-8944 (763-8SV-TWIG). This number is only good for sending text messages to. Calling it will not go anywhere. When we reply to your text message it will be from our iridium number (it might look strange on your phone) +881631403941. If you happen to be using an Iridium device or don’t mind the possible long distance charges you can reply/text us directly to our Iridium number. Short messages (around 140 characters) can alternatively be sent via email to 881631403941@msg.iridium.com These short messages (by phone or email) are typically the fastest delivery because they are sent via push notification to our satellite communication device. Longer email messages up to 40,000 characters (40kB) can be sent to WDJ4453@sailmail.com We download emails sent to this address via satellite and/or long-range HF radio (SSB) once or twice per day.

### EMERGENCY COORDINATION

If there is great cause for concern please contact MRCC in Ponta Delgada, Lisboa Portugal, or CROSS France using the contact details below. We will be sailing in waters called France, MET Area II. North of 48 27N is UK, MET Area I but we do not intend on going that far north!

Explain the cause for concern and give them the details they require. In almost all cases you will simply be _making them aware of_ a possible situation. **DO NOT** request a rescue effort unless you are absolutely certain one is needed. A loss of communication does not necessarily mean we are in any danger.
