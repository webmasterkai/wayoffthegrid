Kai, Emily, Reverie, are sailing across the Atlantic to Portugal! We will be stoping at a collection of islands called the Azores for a couple months before reaching mainland Portugal in the fall. We’re currently in Bermuda and have had a wonderful couple weeks exploring the island. Highly recommend making a visit sometime. The sail to Bermuda was extremely mild, easy and trouble free. Our good sailing friend Ed  has been aboard with us since FL and is continuing on to the Azores. The weather outlook for our roughly two-week passage from Bermuda to the Azores looks favorable. We have hired professional weather forecasters https://www.wriwx.com/ to keep an eye on things as they relate our voyage specifically. They will be sending us regular updates and routing suggestions throughout the passage. We are excited to get sailing!

### TRACKING

We transmit our position over VHF with a Class A Automatic Identification System (AIS) transceiver. This is sends our details to other vessels within a 20 mile radius. It's also received by various shore stations that relay our position to websites like Marine Traffic when they receive our location info. This works when we are as far as 80 miles from shore. We also send our position via satellite to https://www.noforeignland.com/boat/twig/journey and https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/shipid:450795/tracktype:9/lpt:1606661280 Satellite updates are not guaranteed but attempted every 5-10 minutes. Note that there are _sometimes_ spans of several hours where our position is _not_ updated.

Our latest position can be optained by sending a text message to +1 763-878-8944 with the word twig. You should get an automatic reply within a couple minutes. It includes coordinates and the time of the fix in UTC. For example "Twig - 32 22.783 N - 64 40.377 W - 2021-06-10 18:53UTC - 0.1 SOG - 145 COG". The same method can be used to retrieve the position of one of our buddy boats by sending a message with the vessel name.
