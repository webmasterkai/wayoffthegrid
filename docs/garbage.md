# Garbage Disposal

The Captain and crew will abide by all guidelines for overboard discharge as outlined by the US Coast Guard Regulations posted aboard the vessel.

Nonoverboard garbage disposal for non recyclable materials will be collected and stored in the waste receptacle, lined with a plastic bag, located under the galley sinks.

Recyclable materials will be collected and stored in the plastic laundry basket in the main head and bagged as necessary.

Compostable materials will be collected and sealed in a plastic bag located in the laundry basket in the main head or chopped and thrown overboard if rules/laws allow.

Full bags will be removed and stored in the lazarette and/or dinghy until a proper disposal site is available.

Stored full bags will be removed from the lazarette/dinghy and carried ashore for deposit in designated receptacles, at approved sites when docked, moored or at anchor.
