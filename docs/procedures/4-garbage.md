# Garbage Disposal

The Captain and crew will abide by all guidelines for overboard discharge as outlined by the US Coast Guard Regulations posted aboard the vessel.

### Non Recyclables

Collected and stored in the waste receptacle, lined with a plastic bag, located under the galley sinks.

### Recyclables

Collected and stored in the plastic basket under the galley sink and bagged as necessary.

### Compostables

Collected and sealed in a plastic bag located in the main head or chopped and thrown overboard as rules/laws allow.

## Overflow Storage

Full bags will be removed and stored in the lazarette and/or dinghy until a proper disposal site is available. Most often overflow is recycling. Research and patience is often needed before we find a place to bring recycling.

## Removal

Stored full bags will be removed from the boat and carried ashore for deposit in designated receptacles, at approved sites when docked, moored or at anchor.
