# Standing Orders

It's far better to ask for help early and often, than too late.  
**If anyone notices any of the following you MUST alert the Captain:**

* The barometer rises or falls 2MB or more in 1 hour, or if you notice approaching weather; huge convection, lightening or low, dark clouds to windward, or changes in sea state.
* Wind speed increases significantly (10 kts) or changes in direction over 20 degrees.
* A passing ship is projected to come within 2 nm or you see any ships, lights, radar target, or objects that you are not sure you recognize or are unsure of what avoidance action to take.
* You are unable to maintain the prescribed course.
* You hear or feel unidentifiable sounds or vibrations.
* Any crew member becomes ill or injured.
* Anything unusual, unsafe, or concerning is noticed.
* Any type of emergency occurs.

# Watch Duties

1. Understand and follow Standing Orders and Watch Duties. If you are unsure of something, ask.
2. Be ready to go on deck early, at least **5 minutes before** watch starts, with life jacket/harness/tether and clothing appropriate for weather conditions. At night, you must hook on before leaving the companionway.
3. Before coming topside to relieve, check the barometer, battery voltage and bilge.
4. Understand current watch orders and sail plan before relieving watch. During change of watch, communication between off going and oncoming watches should be sufficient to pass on pertinent information and give the oncoming watch a feel for conditions such as current and forecasted weather, course, sail configuration, surroundings and traffic.
5. Maintain prescribed course and minimum speed.
6. Record time, log, course and position every hour on the hour, including any additional pertinent information. Maintain a visual lookout as well as monitoring AIS and radar for traffic and squalls. Be sure to check astern as well.
7. **Constantly** monitor sail trim and adjust as necessary from the safety of the cockpit.
8. If the speed falls below 4 knots for over 30 minutes, start the engine and roll up the headsail. When the wind picks back up, ensure engine is up to temperature, unfurl the appropriate headsail and stop the engine.
9. Reef early and often. Reefing (lower of true/apparent) wind speed guidelines:
  * 1st reef @ 15 knots
  * 2nd reef @ 20 knots
  * 3rd reef @ 25 knots.
10. Monitor engine gauges every 20 minutes while under power.
11. Use VHF Channel 13 and or 16 to make radio contact with vessels sighted if safe passage in doubt.
12. Keep the cockpit neat and tidy.
13. No one is to leave the safety of the cockpit and go forward on deck without a harness and at least one other person on deck.
14. In most conditions, watches will be one person watches of two hours. Number of persons and length of watch may vary according to weather and conditions.
