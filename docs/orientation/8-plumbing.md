## Domestic Water System

### Tanks

Two water tanks (approx. 65 gals each) are located under the port and starboard main saloon settees. Water tank fills are located on each side
deck. The tanks are controlled by valves mounted on the side of the tank, in the storage area under each settee. In normal operation one valve should be on and one off. As the tank in use runs out you can switch to the other tank by reversing BOTH valves. Start by closing the empty tank and then open the other. This gives some warning about your water usage. If both valves are left open, water can and will run from the windward tank to the leeward tank increasing the heel angle. Furthermore there is the possibility that air will be sucked from the higher tank, making it impossible to obtain water from the lower tank. After initial filling or after switching from one tank to the other, eliminate the air in the plumbing (hot and cold sides) by opening each faucet until there is a steady flow of water. The water pressure pump may run and not shut off unless this is done.

Access to tank and clean-out ports requires removal of screws on berth flats and lee-cloths. Capacity is approximately 65 gallons each. The manifold valves controlling the tanks are located under the main cabin sole, immediately aft of the dining table.

Prior to initial usage, during commissioning, the potable water tanks should be flushed with hot (if possible) water to remove manufacturing residue and potable antifreeze. Fill each tank with water mixed with one cup bleach to sanitise the tank. Let sit for several hours. Drain tank (remove sediment strainer bowl, drain into bilge, use bilge pump, replace strainer bowl)

### Hot Water Tank

The hot water tank is located in the aft cabin, under the bed. It requires little maintenance other than winterising. Water can be heated by two means:

1. Engine heat exchanger. This is fully automatic. Whenever the engine is running, engine coolant is being circulated through a heat exchanger in the water tank. 20 min. of engine running will usually heat a tank of water. The tank insulation will keep this tank of water (8 gals) hot for many hours, providing hot water for showers or dish washing even at anchor.
2. AC Power: A 120 volt heating element also heats the water, similar to an electric hot water heater at home. Shorepower must be connected or inverter on and the breakers in the proper position on the electrical panel to make hot water. CAUTION: If hot water tank is empty for any reason (such as winterising) DO NOT turn on the electrical breaker. Applying electricity to a dry heating element will burn it out within seconds!

### Shower Sumps and Drains

The head sinks, icebox, and showers drain into two sumps located in the bilge in the main cabin and forward stateroom. These sumps contain a float switch and centrifugal pump to evacuate them. The toggles on the main panel are manual on switches (not circuit breakers) which will activate the sump pumps should the float switch not activate the pump when desired. The pumps are separately protected by fuses located in the distribution area under the aft berth.

Because of the nature of the drain water which they handle, the pumps and switches are vulnerable to accumulations of soap scum, hair, and other greasy materials. Occasionally the sumps will require cleaning out. The frequency will vary according to you and your crew's habits. The tops to the sump tanks are easily removed and access to the inside is obtained. Household cleaners will take care of the build up inside. (X-14 Soap Scum Remover works well). When leaving your boat for a prolonged period or after a weekend aboard, run several gallons of fresh water through the drains to help clear the sumps and finish off with a cup of bleach to prevent bacteria growth, mold and odours.

### Showers

Are located in both heads. All plumbing hardware is household type and should not present a problem to operate.

The cockpit shower is recessed in two holes covered by plastic caps in the port coaming. One housing contains a telephone-style shower head on a retracting hose. The other contains a mixer faucet with hot and cold water. To turn on the water pull the mixer faucet out to turn on the flow (the button on the shower head must be pressed as well).

Hot and cold mixing is accomplished by turning the mixer handle clockwise or counter clockwise. To turn the faucet off, push in the mixer handle all the way and at the same time release the hose pressure with the shower head button. If you do not release the hose pressure the handle will not remain in a recessed position.

## Reverse Osmosis (RO) Water Maker

### Startup

1. Verify the seawater intake (seacock #9) is open at the through-hull.
* Switch ON the breaker labeled "Water Maker" at the main breaker panel to charge dedicated battery pack. If house bank below 75% SOC and both water tanks are low/empty on both tanks it can remain off if pack voltage is over 13.4v.
* Turn the **High Pressure Bypass Valve** (Stainless with Black Handle) to the OPEN POSITION. Rotate away and down. Pointy end up.
* FAILURE TO OPEN THE HIGH PRESSURE BYPASS VALVE COULD RESULT IN HYDRAULIC SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM.
* Turn on boost switch.
* Check that **Feed Pressure** reaches **15-30 PSI** on feed line.
* Let run for 1-10 minutes.
* Switch **Sample Valve** under galley sink to right, labeled "Sink".
* Turn on boost pump.
* Verify brine discharge is flowing overboard. Check on SB side, lower transom next to swim step.
* Check that feed pressure remains above 10 PSI. If it drops below it's probably time to replace pre-filter.
* Note titanium High Pressure Regulator with hex head. It is used to adjust membrane pressure. Slowly tighten screw (clockwise) atop the High Pressure Regulator to increase pressure or loosen in small increments to reduce pressure.
* Gradually turn the High Pressure Bypass Valve (Black Handle) to CLOSED position.
* **Flow Meter** should be between **5-8 GPH**. If used in fresh or brackish water reduce pressure at High Pressure Regulator as necessary to achieve correct product flow. MUST REAMIN BELOW 8 GPH AT ALL TIMES.
* High pressure **Membrane Gauge** should read between **800-900PSI** in typical salt water. MUST REMAIN BELOW 900PSI.
* Inspect all plumbing connections in the unit for leakage. Cold water temperature can cause condensation.
* Let run into sink for around 5 minutes. IF the unit was filled with preservative storage solution, production must remain diverted AT LEAST 10 MINUTES to clear preservative solution from system.
* Check product water with hand-held TDS meter kept on the top shelf in the cabinet next to the sink.
* When PPM is below 250 in cold water and 400 in warm ensure there is no smell or taste.
* If quality is good, turn the Sample Valve over to the left in "Tank" direction.
* Under the sink under the floor hatch are two valves that control the tank being filled. It should be opposite of the tank being used for consumption.
* Check the RO unit for feed (10-30PSI) and membrane pressure (800-900), water leakage periodically at the initial start-up. Observe Product Flow meter (5-8GPH).

### Shutdown

1. Gradually turn the **High Pressure Bypass Valve** (Stainless with Black Handle) to the OPEN POSITION. Rotate away and down. Pointy end up. This will release the high pressure within the RO system.
2. Switch OFF the breaker labeled "Water Maker" at the main breaker panel or let battery continue to charge if main bank has ample power.
3. The RO unit may be left in this “stand by” condition with the seawater for one day. If the RO unit will be out of service for extended time periods, please refer flushing instructions.

### Water Filters

A charcoal/kdf water filter with a replaceable element is installed inline on the cold water line going to the drinking faucet at the galley sink. Only this drinking faucet is double filtered.

*EVERY FILL-UP* Add a few tablespoons of baking soda, particularly if the water is heavily chlorinated. If filling from a unknown source, a half cup of bleach per tank will help kill algae or bacteria.

*IF CONTAMINATED BY ALGAE* Clean out tanks though access ports in tops of tanks. Add one cup of chlorine bleach per tank, fill with water Let sit for 6-12 hours and flush the solution through the system Periodically clean sediment strainer. Rinse thoroughly with fresh water. Follow steps above for a new tank to complete the cleaning process.

Change water filter elements at least once every 4 months, or whenever flow is reduced.

### Manual Water Pump

A foot-operated water pump is mounted in the galley sole. This pump supplies fresh water to the galley sink faucet, when operating the fresh water pressure pump is not desired. The galley sink faucet must be full on in the cold position for water to flow. A twist of the foot releases and returns the pump to the recessed position.

## 8-4 Bilge Pumps

We are equipped with six bilge pumps. Two are fixed, manual diaphragm pumps, located in the cockpit and below the cabin sole in the main saloon. A third high capacity portable pump and board is mounted just inside the lazaret.

These pumps are rarely used so you should check the operation of each at least once a month. Simply fill the bilge with several gallons of water and pump each. (This is a good practice whenever cleaning the bilge.)

The electric bilge pumps are located in the keel sump and are activated by a float switch. The pump is separately wired to a fuse located under the aft cabin berth. The toggle on the main panel is a manual bypass switch (not a circuit breaker) which will activate the pump should the float switch not activate the pump when desired. Trash can accumulate in the bilge and may be sucked up into the pump body. If the pump runs and does not evacuate the bilge or the flow is reduced, the pump can be removed from its mounting plate by depressing the two small locking tabs at the base of the pump. Check for debris, clean and replace by snapping back into position. See the pump manufacturers instructions. Keep the bilge clean to prevent clogging and also to reduce unpleasant "bilge odour."

## 8-5 Toilets

NEVER put paper towels, wet wipes, floss, tampons/feminine pads, condoms, cotton swabs, cigarette butts, candy wrappers or other foreign items down a marine head! You will jam the toilet.

**If it hasn't passed through your body, it doesn't go down the toilet. We are extreme types so that means toilet tissue as well! A maximum of 10 squares are allowed per flush. A little white waste bin is located next to the toilet for anything extra.**

### Main Head

1. To the right of the sink are two grey push buttons. Water may be added to the bowl by pushing the lower left rocker switch to the right of the sink.
1. To begin flush procedure push the "Start" button. It's to the left of the sink. The status LED should be solid green.
1. To the right of the sink is two buttons. The top push-button switch provides a simple flush mode by activating both the rinse water supply and the macerator discharge pump simultaneously. Push and hold this button as the toilet flushes.
1. If needed the lower rocker switch offers independent control of the rinse water supply and discharge separately so the bowl water level can be easily raised or lowered. This provides a method of raising the water level (lower left button) when appropriate for user comfort.
1. When underway use the lower right rocker-button to completely evacuate the toilet bowl.
1. The Status LED should blink green. If blinking yellow the water is probably brackish and concentrated salt water needs to be added.

#### Acid Treatment/Electrode Cleaning

Cleaning is recommended every SIX MONTHS or if red light and warning for low electrode amps are always on during treatment cycle.

1. Flush a 2/3rds full toilet bowl and activate the Electroscan four times, allowing all waste to be treated.
2. Turn off water supply and flush toilet as dry as possible.
3. Turn Electroscan Power off
4. Disconnect Red, White and orange wires with spade connectors at Electroscan control box.  
WARNING: electro scan must not be activated without disconnecting electrode and motor wires while muriatic acid solution is in the system.
5. In plastic bucket combine 1.5 pints (.852 liters) of muriatic acid with 3 gallons (13.635 liters) of fresh water. (16 water to 1 acid.)
6. Carefully pour solution into the toilet and flush until bowl is as dry as possible.
7. Pour one gallon (3.8 liters) of additional fresh water into bowl to dilute any acid remaining.
8. Allow to stand for between 45 minutes and 3 hours.
9. Turn on water supply and flush only the toilet (WITHOUT activating the Electroscan) a minimum of 10 gallons (38.0 liters) of water to dilute and discharge muriatic acid solution.
9. Reconnect wires and turn power on to Electroscan.

### Forward Head

Excessive use of flushing water will increase the need for pump-outs. Conservative use of flushing water is essential. Everyone on board should be instructed in good marine toilet habits. Your toilet will love you and your holding tank will go many miles further between pump-outs.
WARNING: Resistance on the toilet pump handle almost always indicates a full holding tank, (or a closed discharge valve) DO NOT FORCE!!!! Investigate first. Undue force can rupture holding tank cleanout plates or blow off waste hoses.

When leaving the boat for more than a day, we suggest pumping out the holding tanks, flush thoroughly with fresh water, and add some deodorising chemical. Wastes left to "cook" over a period of time will cause an offensive odour in the boat which may be difficult or near impossible to get rid of.

#### Holding Tank

In addition to the Electroscan in the main head this SAGA 43 has one complete waste systems which is designed to be legal in any location. Waste may be held in the holding tank until a dockside pump out station is reached; or waste in holding tanks may be evacuated overboard by on-board electric macerator pumps, where legal; or waste may be discharged directly overboard from the toilets, where legal.

#### Y-Valve

Each toilet discharge hose is connected to a Y-valve which can be selected to m either divert waste into the holding tank or discharge it directly overboard through a seacock (in which case the overboard discharge seacock must also
be open). The Y-valve is conveniently located near each toilet and is clearly T
marked. In some jurisdictions, this valve may be illegal unless secured in the I tank position. In such a case you may drill a small hole through the longer end of
the valve handle (with the handle in the tank position) and into the fibreglass T
moulding directly beneath. Insert a #8 machine screw (1 1/2" long) through the --' handle and secure with a nyloc nut on the back side. In addition you may be
required to secure the overboard discharge seacock in some fashion (don't drill T a hole as above, the sea is out there!). ->

#### Macerator

The holding tank is equipped with a macerator pump to discharge overboard the waste that has accumulated in the holding tank. This can be done when sailing where it is legal to do so. The pump discharges waste through its own seacock after chopping up solid waste into fine particles.

1. Open the macerator discharge seacock. Only open this seacock when actually using the Macerator pump. Seawater can leak back into holding tank if 1 the seacock is left open.
2. Turn on the proper breaker switch on the main electrical panel. You will hear the pump run and as it sucks in the waste the pitch will drop as it begins pumping. When the pitch increases again the tank is empty.
3. It is a good idea at this time to manually pump the toilet 20-30 strokes with the water intake valve open to flush clean seawater (or fresh using the shower sprayer) into the tank.
4. Run the macerator again until empty.
5. Add some deodoriser chemicals in the toilet and pump several strokes into the holding tank.
6. Close macerator discharge seacock.

#### Deck Pumpout

The holding tank has a deck fitting for use at a dockside facility. The dockside facility will have an adapter fitting which screws into the deck plate to adapt their suction hose. Your dock attendant will be able to assist you. It is a good idea to flush plenty of fresh water through the toilet or into the deck plate to help rinse out the tank. Add some commercial tank chemical afterwards. Your olfactory senses will appreciate it too. Never leave the boat with waste in the holding tanks.
