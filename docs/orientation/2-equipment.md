## Sails

Some preconceived notions about conventional sloops or cutters may need to be discarded in order to understand how the Saga 43's Variable Geometry rig works. It's not a cutter or a sloop in the usual sense and the techniques for sailing it are a tad different than what you may be used to. The rig is proportioned so that an overlapping head sail is never required. The inner head sail is used when sailing close-hulled, even in light air. As it is self-tending, tacking simply requires a turn of the wheel, no crew required. Off the wind, the reaching genoa is deployed to both add sail area and shift the center of pressure forward to maintain an extra light helm pressure on all points of sail. At deeper angles downwind an asymmetrical spinnaker can be flown from the bowsprit. Furthermore, the Saga 43 will remain well balanced and easily steered even when pressed hard on a tight reach, unlike conventionally rigged boats. Mainsail hoisting and reefing chores are easily taken care of inside the safety of the cockpit with a push of the button on the two speed self-tailing electric winch.

The Saga 43 is no slouch on the water. Impressive sail area/displacement ratio of 20.01. Most recently 73 PHRF; NE PHRF is 81.

## Hull and Deck

The hull of the Saga 43 has a nearly plumb bow and rakish stern with a convenient walk-out swim platform. Construction of the hull is of hand-laid fiberglass, using premium grade polyester resin, with two layers of Vinylester resin for added osmotic protection. There is aircraft grade Baltek balsa coring in the hull and deck; the core is voided or replaced with high density backing plates in areas of thru-hulls or deck hardware attachment. Along the keel is additional heavy duty keel solid laminate layup for additional keel and mast support strength. The aluminum slotted toe rail has a PVC rub rail for full length hull side protection. The keel is externally hung lead with a double row of 10 1" keel bolts. All bulkheads and furniture components are fully bonded to the hull and deck. The hull to deck joint is thru-bolted on 4" centers and bonded with polyurethane adhesive sealant. There is a massive sub floor framing structure utilizing bi-directional E-Glass reinforcements for hull stiffness and added strength. The exterior is tropics friendly, with no exterior teak to maintain. The cockpit seats have nice high coamings for great back support and are 7'6" long, making them wonderful for cockpit sleeping. Foot braces are molded into the cockpit sole for the helm and crew.

This is the only Saga with almond colored gelcoat on the hull, deck and non-skid.
