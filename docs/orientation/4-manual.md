We recommend **The Annapolis Book of Seamanship** by John Rousmaniere, (Simon & Schuster, pub.) for its comprehensive coverage of topics relating to the safe and seamanlike operation of any small craft. Seamanship and boat handling in the variety of conditions you will encounter during your sailing career is beyond the scope of an owner's manual. Ultimately the safety, comfort and well-being of vessel and crew lies in the hands of the skipper and crew. We can only provide you with the finest craft we are capable of building, the rest is up to you.

### Dealer Commissioning Responsibilities

There are certain tasks we are unable to accomplish prior to delivery of the yacht to a commissioning dealer. Consequently, the commissioning dealer must be responsible for the completion of the following tasks as part of his normal pre-delivery practices. A commissioning fee that will cover labour costs and incidental expenses is normally charged in addition to the purchase price of the vessel. It must be understood that the described operations have to be completed prior to operation of your new boat. They are not covered under the SAGA Marine Limited Warranty.

1. **Propeller Shaft Alignment** This must be performed after the boat is launched and subsequent to the mast being stepped and the rigging tuned. As the shaft coupling and engine mounts must be adjusted for proper shaft alignment, the coupling bolts and engine mounts can only be secured by the commissioning dealer after the alignment is completed. This task is the sole responsibility of the commissioning dealer.
2. **Engine Set Up** Your local authorized Yanmar service representative should perform a pre-delivery inspection and also a post-launch inspection to carry out any necessary adjustments. Idle speed, shift and throttle cable adjustments, belt tensioning, fluid and lubricant levels are not covered under the SAGA Marine Limited Warranty.
3. **Mast and Rigging** The commissioning dealer is responsible for the stepping (installation) of your mast and its rigging. The mast must be tuned, that is the mast itself should be without athwartships bends and the shrouds and stays tightened to the recommended tension. If additional adjustments are necessary after the first month of sailing, there may be a labour charge for this service. The commissioning dealer is responsible for securing the standing rigging and lifelines with proper sized cotter pins in addition to ensuring that chafe protection is carried out. The dealer is also responsible for ensuring that the mast is properly blocked and covered in the mast partners so as to eliminate leaks around the mast.
4. **LPG (Propane) System** The LPG tank supplied with your SAGA Yacht is shipped empty as required by safety. Stresses incurred during transportation (primarily vibration) make it imperative that the LPG system be leak tested by the commissioning dealer as part of his normal delivery practices. Filling the propane tank and ensuring that the entire LPG system is leak free prior to delivery is the responsibility of the commissioning dealer.  
_Before operation of any LPG-fueled appliance, READ the relevant manual and understand the warnings. BE SURE you know how to safely operate the appliance, how to leak test and the proper steps to be taken in the event of a gas leak. Consult your dealer if you have any questions about safe operation of the appliance._
5. **Plumbing Leaks** Minor leaks may occur in the water system owing to vibration and shocks during shipping. Changes in pressure and temperature when the system is initially operated may also cause leaks. It is the responsibility of the commissioning dealer to operate the water and plumbing systems during commissioning and to eliminate such leaks as are found at that time.
6. **Minor Flaws in Varnish** The woodwork found in the cabins of your SAGA i Yacht is covered with three coats of polyurethane varnish. Minor scrapes and dings may occur during shipping, unpacking or commissioning. SAGA Marine provides a varnish touch-up kit with every boat. Some owners may desire the even finer finish that is only achievable by additional coats of varnish. Ask your dealer for references to a qualified vamisher. Varnishing is a demanding task that requires time to learn properly; a yacht-quality vamisher will be expensive.
7. **Sticking drawers and doors** The cabinetry and joinerwork found in a SAGA Yacht are hand-crafted. The high level of humidity found in the marine environment will always affect the woodwork on a boat. The minor final adjustments of fit for doors, drawers and cabinets can only be done after the boat has spent time in the water. Some additional changes may still be
experienced even after your dealer has made these initial adjustments.

## CONSTRUCTION OF YOUR SAGA YACHT

### Hull

The hull of the SAGA 43 is a one-piece fibreglass sandwich moulding utilizing an end-grain balsa core to achieve stiffness and light weight in the composite lamination. The exterior finish is a premium grade ISO-NPG polyester gelcoat that has been sprayed into the highly polished hull mold. Two laminate layers,
using vinylester resin for increased resistance to osmotic blistering, are applied to the inside of the gelcoat. Additional layers, using biaxial fibreglass cloth are then laminated into the hull mold. The balsa core material is sandwiched between these inner layers and outer laminate skins. This multi-layer building technique adds strength and stiffness properties to the hull while ensuring that overall weight is kept to a minimum. The end-grain balsa core material is removed in areas where through-hulls or fittings are to be installed; this eliminates any potential of water incursion into the core material. Areas that may be subjected to increased stress have additional laminates for greater strength. Polyester resins are utilised in the remainder of the laminations following the vinylester layers.

### Deck

The deck and cockpit are formed by a single fibreglass moulding with a
gelcoated surface. End-grain balsa core is incorporated into the structure for  stiffness. Core material has been removed in all areas where hardware and deck
fittings are located to eliminate the potential of water incursion into the core material. For high stress fittings, aluminum plate is incorporated into the  laminate for additional strength. The contrasting non-skid finish is moulded into the deck. Before drilling holes in the deck, cabin house or cockpit, consult the deck laminate drawing in this manual. (Sec. 11 Drawings)

### Hull-Deck Joint

The hull-deck joint is secured both mechanically and chemically. The hull's moulded flange is coated with a high-tenacity, polyurethane marine adhesive sealant; the deck is then placed on the hull flange and fastened through the extruded aluminum toe rail to the hull by stainless steel bolts every 4 inches.

The adhesive sealant used in the hull-deck joint fulfills two extremely important requirements.

1. Prevention of leaks in the hull-deck joint as it undergoes the stresses of sailing, owing to the flexibility of the sealant.
2. Increased strength for the hull-deck joint due to the adhesive nature of the sealant.

If the SS fasteners should ever need maintenance or in the event of damage in the gunwale area, we take particular care to make the fasteners accessible with removable interior panels wherever possible. The external vinyl rubrail, which provides important topsides and gunwale collision protection, is inserted into a channel in the aluminum toe rail. Should the vinyl rubrail ever need replacing, it can be readily accomplished, by the owner, without disturbing the hull-deck seal.

### Rudder & Steering

The rudder is constructed of two moulded composite shells filled with a low density fibreglass compound to prevent water incursion and damage. The two halves are bonded together around the 4" dia. stainless steel rudder post. Stainless steel plates are welded to the rudder post to provide additional strength and stiffness in the rudder blade.

The rudder may be removed by loosening the retaining collar and steering quadrant, which are found under the cockpit. The rudder must be supported from below during this procedure, then lowered carefully. This is normally carried out with the boat hauled out of the water but may be accomplished with the boat afloat. The rudder post passes through the hull with a close tolerance fit between the shaft and the waterproof bearings.

EDSON RADIAL DRIVE® wheel steering is installed on some SAGA 43s, others have Whitlock COBRA steering. The steering wheel is on a tapered shaft secured by a large nut and a keyway in both cases. Inside the pedestal, on the shaft, is a gear; this is the case for both types of steering. In the EDSON, a heavy-duty SS chain passes over the gear, to each end of the chain a cable is attached. The two cables are linked to the radial drive quadrant which is clamped around the rudder post. EDSON has provided maintenance instructions concerning the steering system.

The Whitlock COBRA steering system uses a quadrant gear to drive a SS tube in the pedestal, this connects to another SS tube in the lazarette that transmits motion to a steering arm attached to the rudder post.

Excellent access to the steering system is afforded through the cockpit sail locker.

### Ballast

The keel of your SAGA Yacht is an external, lead ballast type. The lead is alloyed with antimony for added strength and hardness. It is cast in one piece to Robert Perry's design. Beyond providing stability for the yacht, the sophisticated foil shape of the keel produces hydrodynamic lift while sailing to windward, reducing leeway angle and enhancing upwind performance. The keel is shaped to minimise drag, maximise lift, and carries a substantial bulb at its tip to increase stability without excessive ballast weight. Shoal draft keels have a larger bulb and additional ballast to provide a righting moment similar to the deep draft version.

The keel is fastened to a heavily reinforced hull sump by means of stainless steel bolts which are cast into the lead. These bolts project through the keel sump and are bedded with sealing material to prevent water leaks. The bolts are secured by large stainless steel nuts and backing plates that are accessible in the bilge beneath the saloon sole. The deep keel sump significantly lowers the centre of gravity of the ballast weight while providing a collection point for bilge water. (Without a deep sump, bilge water can run up into lockers when the boat heels.)


## DECK GEAR

When your SAGA yacht arrives at the commissioning boat yard, there are many pieces of equipment not installed. The smaller items will be packed inside the boat, larger items will be on the boat trailer. The pulpit, dorade vents and their guardrails, lifelines and stanchions can't be installed because of highway bridge height restrictions. Various blocks are left off to prevent damage and pilferage.

### Lifelines and Stanchions

You will find the lifelines and stanchions taped together and marked Port and Starboard with a Top and Bottom for each lifeline. Before installing the stanchions, find the box that contains the furling line blocks. Install the blocks on 3 the stanchions as needed and then place the stanchions into the bases along each toerail. The two stanchions at each lifeline gate have diagonal braces.

After installing the stanchion, screw down the diagonal brace using a
sealant in the screw hole. Each stanchion has a fastening bolt that is inserted into the stanchion base from the outboard side. Use Loc Tite® or a marine sealant on the threads of the bolt to prevent loosening. The stanchions are slightly loose in the bases to prevent interaction between the SS and aluminum in salt water that could cause the stanchions to seize in the bases.

Unroll the lifelines, attach one end to the gate stanchions (fore and aft) and insert the other end through each stanchion in sequence. The next step will require two people.

### Pulpit and Pushpit
Before the bow and stern rails can be installed, the navigation lights they carry must be hooked up. The electrical wires will be sticking up from two sockets on the bowsprit and from the deck aft, outboard of the cockpit coaming. The wires from the boat have male/female electrical plugs with corresponding plugs hanging from two legs of the pulpit and one leg of the pushpit. Connect the wires and tape over the connections with electrical tape.

Place the pulpit legs into their respective sockets and push down until the attaching screw can be inserted into the corresponding threaded hole in each leg. If there is resistance in the two sockets with wiring, you must go below and crawl into the anchor locker. Gently pull down on the wires where they come through the deck. This will prevent pinching the wires between the pulpit legs and the socket.

When all of the screws in the sockets have been tightened, you may attach the lifelines to the appropriate places on the pulpit.

The pushpit (stern rail) is fastened to the boat with through bolts in each base. The fastener holes have been drilled at the plant and then filled with a soft putty for travel. When you remove the putty, be sure that all of it is cleared from the holes. The bolts, nuts and washers will be found with the other deck gear in a package marked: "stern rail bolts". A small tube of non-adhesive marine sealant is needed to seal the bolt holes. Don't fill the holes with the sealant! Wrap each bolt with a layer of the sealant from the head down for about an inch. This
provides a better seal and makes the job of the person in the lazarette slightly easier while they tighten the nuts on each bolt. As with the pulpit, once the bolts have been tightened you attach the lifelines to the eyes on the rail.

### Blocks

In addition to the stanchion mounted furling line blocks, there are two small swivel blocks that will need mounting on the pulpit; they are the first lead blocks aft of the furling drums.

The number of blocks used for the self-tacking jib is determined by the sheeting system on your boat. Three blocks are needed for our original system and two are used when the jib sheet goes up and into the mast.

At the mast collar, you will shackle on blocks for the main halyard, main sheet, and the two reefing lines. If you have the in-mast sheeting system, a block is needed for the jib sheet. You may decide how you wish to place the blocks according to your own preferences. Our normal layout puts one block on the port side for the main halyard, then the main sheet block with the two reef lines on the aft face of the collar and a final block to starboard.

The main sheet block system has the following components: One fiddle block with becket, one double and three singles. The fiddle block is shackled to the main traveler car, the double block goes on the after bail on the underside of the boom, one single block is attached to the forward bail, the next is shackled to the vang tang on the boom and the third will go on the mast collar.

Messenger cords are run in the deck molding to allow you to pull the necessary lines through to the line jammers by the companionway.

### Dorade Vent Guards

The SS rails that protect the dorade cowls are mounted on small metal stubs that are screwed to the deck with fasteners through the leg into the stub. The rails are marked as to proper location on the deck.


## RIGGING

### Description

We recommend that, a professional yacht rigger be employed to set up your mast and rig. Your commissioning dealer will employ, or be able to recommend, a rigger for your boat. If you wish to carry out your own mast and rigging work / after the original commissioning, it is essential that you familiarise yourself with the basic principles of mast tuning. Tuning involves adjusting the tension in the shrouds and stays so that the mast will remain straight from side to side in most sailing conditions with an appropriate amount of rake and fore to aft bend for comfortable helm balance. Tuning must be carried out in two phases - tuning at the dock and tuning while under sail. Some definitions and explanations follow.

*Standing rigging* refers to the fixed pieces of stainless steel rod or wire supporting the mast. Those which offer fore and aft supports are called stays 1 (backstay, forestay, etc.). The forward-most stay which carries the genoa/reacher is known as the forestay; the Jib stay, next aft, is also known as the inner forestay. Those which provide athwartships (transverse) support are called shrouds. The shroud running from the masthead to a chainplate on the deck near the rail is the cap or upper shroud. Below it, originating at the upper spreader base is the intermediate shroud. At the lower spreaders, there are two lower shrouds on each side, the forward lowers (port and starboard) and the after lowers (port and starboard).

*Chainplates* are SS weldments bolted to the structure of the hull to which the shrouds are attached.

*Mast partners* refers to the hole in the deck through which the mast passes. The butt, or foot, of the mast sits on the mast step in the bilge. Both the boom and the mechanical vang are attached to the mast at universal joints known as goosenecks.

### Spars

With a shroud running straight from the masthead to the chainplate the angle of support would be so narrow as to induce extremely large stress forces in the shroud and equally large compressive forces in the mast. To increase the angle between the mast and shroud, and reduce the strain, spreaders are positioned on the sides of the mast according to load requirements. The shrouds are then pushed out from the mast by the spreaders, reducing the strains in shroud and mast. Each spreader is angled upwards to bisect the angle formed by the shroud as it bends over the spreader tip. A horizontal spreader, or worse still a spreader angled downwards, is dangerous. The spreader may slip further down the shroud resulting in the loss of the spreader and possible collapse of the mast tube. On the SAGA mast, high-strength aluminum bars are located in the mast at each spreader position. Bent to the proper angle and pinned to the spreaders, they prevent the spreaders from moving. The spreaders are also swept aft at 8°. The aft sweep of the spreaders provides additional support in the fore and aft plane, establishes 'pre-bend' in the mast and allows us to do away with the complexities of running backstays. The forward lower shrouds further lessen the need for running backstays.

The spreader becomes a compressive member, and when properly loaded tends to push the middle of the mast to leeward and forward. To eliminate such a leeward bow, additional shrouds are installed, running from the mast at the base of each spreader down to the deck at the shroud chainplate. The intermediate shroud is one piece from mast terminal to the chainplate on a SAGA 43. This allows tuning the mast without the necessity of going aloft in a bosun's chair. The addition of the spreaders, the intermediate shroud, and lower shrouds means that the mast is supported at more places transversely than fore and aft. The mast therefore has a lesser, but more aerodynamically efficient, transverse width than its fore and aft dimension.

Based upon the relationships described above, the more spreaders and shrouds used transversely, and the more intermediate forestays and running backstays used longitudinally, the smaller the allowable mast section may be. This can be advantageous as weight aloft and windage may be reduced in addition to minimising the undesirable aerodynamic effect of the mast on the mainsail. The smaller the mast section, the less disturbed is the air flow across the mainsail. However, a practical and functional balance of rig complexity, strength and aerodynamic efficiency has governed the design of the rig of the SAGA 43. A double spreader rig with a substantial mast section was specified over a triple spreader rig to reduce tuning complexity and increase overall reliability. Drag and its detrimental effect on the main is reduced by virtue of the aerodynamically
shaped cross section to the mast.

### Mast Stepping

As stated earlier, we recommend employing a professional rigger when your SAGA Yacht is being commissioned for the first time. The following description of mast preparation and stepping cannot cover all contingencies and is only a guide.

Most often, you will find that the boat yard removes the mast from the delivery truck using a fork lift. Three sturdy sawhorses, or mast supports, should be ready to receive the mast, spaced equidistant along the 67 ft. length of the mast. Once assembled, mast with rigging will weigh approximately 700 lbs, be sure the mast supports are strong enough. The mast will need to be placed where it can be worked on without interfering with traffic movement in the yard and convenient for the crane operator to pick it up.

Ask the crane operator, who will be placing the mast into the boat, for their preference as to whether the mast should be forward side up or aft face up on the supports. After the spreaders are attached, you will not be able to roll the mast on the supports. It is preferable to have the track (aft face) side up, it is then much easier to install the Batt-Cars®.
Offshore SparsTM, our mast builder, labels all the components in your mast and rigging to avoid confusion. This is particularly important when attaching the spreaders and shrouds as mixing pieces will lead to extra hours of work. Labels should also be used whenever the mast is removed from the boat for winter storage or other reasons.

Insert the spreader bars into the mast. Layout the shrouds on each side of the mast in their respective positions, attach the spreaders to the spreader bars with the clevis pin heads on the upper side of each spreader. Insert the cotter (split)
pins and spread the legs about 45°. Tape over the pins with a continuous wrap
completely around the spreader using a stretchy plastic tape. (Rig RapTM is one - brand).
When you have unrolled the shrouds, you will see a tag on each identifying it.
Wrap the turnbuckles in rags or cover with plastic bags to keep them clean while
you drag the shrouds around the mast. Attach the lower shrouds to their respective tangs and then with twine tie them to
the mast at their bottom ends. Be sure the forward lowers are forward and the aft n lowers are aft; port and starboard can be swapped but not forward and aft. y
The intermediate shrouds are then attached and led down along the mast, don't
put them into the spreader caps until after the cap shrouds have been attached.

At the end of each spreader is a cap held on by two screws. The upper spreader caps have one hole for the cap shroud.
Remove the caps and lay the cap shroud into the groove and reattach the
spreader cap. It is advisable to put a small amount of silicone sealant onto the threads of the screws. This has a double purpose: It prevents the screws from
backing out and it reduces dissimilar metal corrosion between the SS screws and the aluminum of the spreader. You will see two holes in the lower spreader cap, the larger diameter one is for the cap shroud, the other of course is for the  intermediate shroud. Replace caps the same as for the upper spreaders.

Pull all shrouds as tight as possible down along the mast and tie them off. Be  sure that the lines holding the shrouds can be reached from the deck as themast is being lowered into the mast partners.
The furling gear should be put together by a professional yacht rigger to ensure correct assembly. This is a responsibility of the commissioning dealer. The
furling lines are marked for genoa and jib and they are also of differing sizes:  5/16" x 70 ft. for the jib and 3/8" x 90 ft.for the genoa. {
After the two furling headstays are assembled, they may be attached to their proper tangs as can be the backstay. The weight of the furling drums requires secure lashing to the mast. Although the headstays will sag to the ground along
their length, don't tie them up to the mast. They need to be free as the mast is 'I lowered into the mast partners. "'
The halyards are marked as to purpose and there are messenger lines run in , | the mast to facilitate pulling the halyards through. *
Even when you have accomplished rigging your mast by yourself, at this point a 1 crane is necessary for the actual stepping. Let the boat yard do it! You can
facilitate matters by removing the saloon table, picking up the floorboards in way
til.
 of the mast, taking down the wooden mast ring on the overhead and having cardboard ready to wrap around the mast as it is lowered into the deck. The cardboard will keep scratches on the mast to a minimum.

### 5-4 Tuning at Dockside
All tumbuckles are equipped with toggles to eliminate bending load on the
terminals and tumbuckles. Toggles are also fitted to both ends of the forestay. As the boat tacks and the headsail loading varies from side to side, the forestay terminals are subject to side loading; i.e., loads not in the straight line from masthead to tack fitting.
Begin tuning the spar by ensuring that the mast is in the centre of the boat,
perpendicular to the deck. Slacken the lower shrouds by unwinding their tumbuckles until they are without tension. The backstay should be just tight
enough to remove any visible sag. Take the main halyard and lead the shackle end to a point on the rail or chainplate. Look up to ensure the halyard is not
wrapped around the lazy jacks or a spreader and is running in a straight line from the masthead. NOTE: It is easier to tune the mast before attaching the
boom to its gooseneck. Adjust the halyard so that the shackle just touches the reference point with a given downward tension, then cleat the halyard. Take the
halyard to the same reference point on the opposite side of the boat, again look up to check that halyard is clear. With the same amount of downward tension, you should be able to just touch the shackle to the reference point - jf the mast is plumb transversely. If not, unscrew the upper shroud tumbuckle on the side where the halyard indicates the masthead is further away and take up on the other in order to bring the masthead closer to centre line until the halyard shackle touches both reference points using the same downward tension.
The particular part of the rail or deck you choose as your reference point is not
important as long as it is the same point on each side and close to the
chainplates. Once the mast is centred transversely, tighten both upper shroud tumbuckles uniformly, one turn one side, then one turn on the other, using a 12
in. wrench and a 12 in. screwdriver. NOTE: It is preferable to use the proper size of open-end wrench but a crescent wrench may be used. Repeat until the
tumbuckles become difficult to turn. Pin the tumbuckles.
Tighten the intermediate shroud tumbuckles so that almost all of the slack is removed. Sight up the aft side of the mast to make sure that it is straight
athwartships, then tighten alternately port and starboard until the tumbuckles become difficult to turn with the wrench. Pin the tumbuckles. Repeat this
procedure with the lower shrouds. The lower shrouds may require adjustment to straighten the mast.
Now check for pre-bend. There should be 4 to 6 inches of fore and aft bend in the mast. If not, tension the backstay adjuster (if fitted) or the backstay tumbuclles until 6" of bend appears when sighted up the aft edge of the spar. Then equally tension upper and intermediate shrouds going alternately from port to starboard tumbuckles. Release back stay tension and 4-6 inches of pre-bend should remain in the mast. The lower shrouds may require adjustment to straighten the mast athwartships after this step.
Now check the rake. Rake is the fore and aft angle of the spar.

The SAGA 43 spar is designed to carry up to a maximum 12 inches of rake. Rake effects the
position of the centre of effort of your sail plan and, consequently, the balance of the helm. The effects are more pronounced in heavier winds. The extent of rake
on your boat should be determined by your particular sailing characteristics, the typical local wind conditions and your sail maker's suggestions.
Forward rake should be avoided. The main halyard may be used to measure rake. In calm wind and sea. With the boat floating level on her lines, hang a
plumb weight or equivalent, such as a hammer or wrench, from the main halyard. Adjust the halyard so that the weight is suspended just above the gooseneck. The fore and aft distance between the mast and the halyard at the gooseneck level is the amount of rake. Ease off the forestay tumbuckles and tighten the backstay tumbuckle (or vice versa) until the desired rake is achieved. Pin both fore and backstay tumbuckles.
Unless the rake has to be readjusted in the future to correct helm balance, these tumbuckles will need no more adjusting. Additional tension may be applied by the backstay adjuster.
The outboard ends of the spreaders will need to be padded and taped to avoid
chafing the genoa/reacher. Ensure that all tumbuckles are pinned. You will be ready to complete the tuning procedure while sailing once the boom is installed.

### 5-5 Tuning While Sailing

Select a day with a steady 12 to 15 knot breeze and reasonably flat seas. Put
the boat on starboard tack, close hauled. Sight up the luff track of the mast. If
the mast seems to fall off to leeward at the spreaders, tack and tighten the
starboard lower shroud or intermediate as necessary. Put the boat back on
starboard tack and check the spar again, repeat as necessary. When the mast
appears straight, bring the boat about and do the same on the port side. When
you first sight up the mast, the mast head may appear to be falling off to leeward. The cap shrouds may be too loose but the intermediate and lowers
might be too tight. Or - the mast may have an S-curve, falling off at one spreader and poking up to windward at the other with the masthead to windward or to
leeward.
The many possible variations in the tension of the shrouds cause us to emphasize the importance of employing a professional yacht rigger at least
initially in tuning your mast. You will find it far easier to duplicate the tuning if it has been performed properly the first time.
Check the following carefully.
When the upper shrouds are at optimum tension, in 15 to 20 knots of wind, the
leeward shrouds will feel "looser" than the windward but they should not be

When your boat is new, the rigging may stretch to the extent that retuning will become necessary in a matter of weeks. However, after this initial working-in period, you will find that the rig tends to hold its tune throughout the sailing

appear quite sagged. Tensioning the backstay will reduce the amount of sag, but the sag can never be totally eliminated.

The important thing to remember about setting up your mast is to go about the
process in a slow and orderly fashion. Record the details of the tuning and re- tune procedures as well as the results achieved. This will provide you with a better understanding of the rig and will serve as a useful reference for rigging
the boat on subsequent occasions.


## 6 PROPULSION SYSTEMS
### 6-1 Engine

All necessary specifications and information concerning the Yanmar engine installed aboard your yacht may be found in the engine manufacturer's Owner's  Manual. Read this manual carefully so that it is thoroughly understood. The life and performance of the engine will depend upon the care it is given.

As a daily routine, before starting your engine:  
1. Check engine lube oil level and coolant level.
2. Check alternator/water pump belt condition and tension.
3. Make a quick visual check of engine and sump for any coolant, fuel or oil.
4. Visually check seawater strainer for debris. (Is the seacock open?)
5. Visually check fuel filter bowl for signs of water or algae growth. Black
specks indicate algae growth, water will show as a clear bubble at the ) bottom.
6. Check for trailing lines, sheets, or dinghy painters (tow line) that could foul the prop.
7. MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO SWIMMERS NEARBY IN THE WATER.

**IMPORTANT CAUTION #1:**  
As the exhaust system relies entirely on the pressure of combustion gas to discharge the cooling water from the muffler through the transom pipe, there is a potential to flood the exhaust system and possibly even the engine cylinders with seawater if the engine starter motor is cranked for more than one minute total time, without the engine actually starting. If the engine fails to start within 30 seconds total and accumulative cranking time— DO NOT CRANK ENGINE ANY FURTHER with sea water intake valve open. SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE MAY RESULT!
You may crank the engine with the inlet seacock closed to diagnose the starting problem. Be prepared to quickly open the seacock after the engine starts.

**IMPORTANT CAUTION #2:**  
If whenever the engine is being operated and the overheat alarm sounds, or there is no raw cooling water exiting the exhaust pipe at the stern, immediately shut down the engine and investigate. Engine damage will result if ignored.

Furthermore, since the exhaust system is largely water-cooled and non-metallic the excessive heat of un-cooled exhaust gas will melt the muffler and exhaust hoses, resulting in a situation where following seas could potentially enter and flood the yacht through the exhaust pipe.

Always inspect the integrity of the exhaust system after any engine overheat incident, no matter how minor. If you are in a situation where you must have the engine propelling the boat, such as a narrow channel or heavily trafficed area, the safety of your crew and boat must be considered more important than damage to the engine. Every captain must be able to make the correct decision by themselves, neither this manual nor any other advice is capable of covering every contingency.

### 6-2 Transmission
The reduction gears and reverse gears are contained in the transmission casing attached to the after end of the engine. These gears normally require little maintenance. The gearbox oil should be checked from time to time; see the Engine Owners Manual for the location of the dip stick.
To avoid damage to the gears and to increase clutch life, the engine should ALWAYS be at idle speed (<1000 RPM) when shifting gears.

### 6-3 Propeller Shaft

The propeller shaft in your yacht is 1.25 in. stainless steel. The shaft is supported at the inboard end by the shaft coupling and at the outboard end by the strut which contains a water lubricated bearing (cutless). The shaft passes through the hull at the stuffing box which is equipped with a "drip-less" type shaft seal.

### 6-4 Shaft Alignment

The shaft is coarsely aligned at the factory and the boat should not be operated (except briefly and with low engine speed) until a final alignment has been carried out. The propeller shaft and the engine can only be properly aligned after launching. This should be done by your dealer prior to delivery to you. The alignment should be rechecked, at any time if there is excess vibration when the engine is running or if loss of engine speed becomes evident but particularly after a haulout. Improper alignment can cause premature wear of the drive line components. We recommend that a competent professional perform shaft alignment as misalignment can result in expensive repairs.

It is a good idea to do the final shaft alignment AFTER the rig is tuned and with the backstay tension fully relaxed. Backstay tension may affect alignment.

Briefly, alignment is checked in the following manner:  
a) Remove the flange bolts on the shaft coupling adjacent to the transmission case.
b) Support the weight of the shaft and coupling, then slide the coupling faces together by hand.
c) While holding the coupling faces together, insert a feeler gauge and check the clearance at four points around the coupling. (3,6,9, & 12 o'clock). There should be no more than .003" variation in the gap between the faces.
If the coupling faces are misaligned, the engine mounts can be adjusted until the coupling faces match evenly.
Replace and carefully secure flange bolts and locking devices after successfully completing the alignment check. Loc-Tite® nut seal is recommended on coupling and engine mounting nuts as they are subject to severe vibration.

### 6-5 Stuffing Box
The stuffing box is located at the inboard end of the fibreglass tube which passes through the hull. The fibreglass tube and the stuffing box are connected by means of a short length of flexible rubber tubing held in place by hose clamps. These clamps and the stuffing box should be inspected on a regular basis. Replace clamps if any sign of corrosion or rusting is present. If leaking is found, the hose clamps should be checked. If the shaft to be removed and the "Strong Seal" repaired. For more information read
leak is excessive, the stuffing box seal must be serviced. This requires the prop the Strong Seal information included with your owners information.
NOTE: The rubber tubing and clamps at the stuffing box must be inspected at least yearly.

### 6-6 Propellers

A folding propeller is fitted, it must be recognized that it generally has lower reverse thrust than other types. Plan your docking maneuvers accordingly.

When sailing, it is preferable to lock the propeller shaft to help engage feathering of the propeller by putting the engine in reverse gear after it has been shut off. This will prevent the propeller from rotating or "free-wheeling." You should not be sailing at a speed of more than two or three knots when you shift into reverse. Sudden reversing of the direction of rotation of the prop shaft puts strain on the transmission, slower is better. The design of the Yanmar transmission is such as to prevent the transmission being shifted back into neutral until the transmission has stopped its rotation.

The standard propeller supplied with the yacht is a fixed three-bladed bronze unit. It's in storage as a spare.

### 6-7 Exhaust System
The exhaust system utilises a waterlift type muffler. In operation, the engine water pump draws water through the sea water intake valve, circulates it through the engine heat exchanger and then injects it into the exhaust elbow. The cooling water mixes with the exhaust gases in the muffler and is discharged overboard by exhaust gas pressures through the exhaust pipe in the stern of the yacht. From the engine exhaust elbow onward the system is water-cooled and constructed of non-metallic, non-corrosive components and should provide you with years of dependable service. However at least semi-annually, inspect the system for leaks and replace any hose clamps that show signs of corrosion.

### 6-8 Fuel System

#### Fuel Tanks

The fuel tanks are located beneath the cabin sole and are static grounded. The fuel tank selector provides for switch over of both feed and return lines. The manifold is located in the engine compartment.

#### Fueling
Even though your SAGA is equipped with a diesel engine, before opening the fuel inlet deck cap, it is prudent to ensure that all open flames aboard the yacht are extinguished, no person is smoking and that the electrical main switch as well as all electrical circuits are turned to "OFF." It is good practice to close all ports and hatches adjacent to the fuel fill to keep the diesel fumes out of the cabin. Locate the tank vents and monitor them throughout the fueling operation.

Be careful not to fill tanks at a rate faster than the vents can relieve air pressure in the tank. Fuel docks that seldom have sailboat clients often have higher pressure fuel fills that may cause problems of fuel backing up in the fill pipe.  Slow down the fuel flow, or stop fueling if there is any spitting of fuel from the vent or fill pipe. With the tanks located deep in the bilge there is considerable hose length and filling is slow, this is normal. Once the tank has been filled, close the inlet cap tightly and wash down any spills with fresh water and an
approved biodegradable oil dispersant.

#### Fuel Quality
For specific fuel grades refer to the engine Owner's Manual.
Clean fuel is critical to diesel engine performance and service life. As diesel fuel is stored (in your yacht's tanks or ashore before you purchase it) water buildup from atmospheric condensation and the growth of micro-organisms are constantly degrading the fuel. Use of secondary fuel filters (such as the Racors) and approved fuel conditioners and biocides (such as RACOR® brand or BIO-BORTM) are recommended. Try to purchase your fuel at high volume locations. In remote cruising locations, or whenever fuel quality is suspect, use of an external flow-through "pre-filter/water separator" (Baja filter) is highly recommended when filling up.

#### Fuel Filters
Your SAGA is equipped with a set of RACOR® fuel filter/water separators in addition to the paper element filter supplied by the engine manufacturer. Consult the RACOR® instructions and the engine owner's manual for instructions on how and when to service the filters. Be sure to obtain replacement filter elements for the model of filters installed on your SAGA and carry them with you at all times. Filter element life is controlled primarily by the quality of fuel and secondarily by the amount of fuel used. The quality of fuel is often unpredictable. The fuel filter bowl should be checked every day and the paper element after every 50 hours of service. The filter element should be replaced whenever there is visible contamination of the filter surfaces. The filter element should be replaced prior to the start of every sailing season even if they appear to be clean.

### 6-9 Starting and Operating the Engine

Please refer to the engine Owner's Manual for starting procedure and engine panel functions. Thoroughly familiarise yourself with engine shift and throttle  controls before attempting to start the engine or get underway.

1. Turn the engine start battery switch to "ON."
2. Check that engine water intake valve is open.
3. Check that the gear shift lever is in neutral.
4. Follow specific instructions as laid out in engine Owner's Manual.
5. After starting engine, immediately check exhaust pipe in stern for cooling water flow. Shut down engine and determine cause, if cooling water does not flow within 10 seconds of engine starting.

Note: When a folding propeller is fitted, excessive vibration may occur when the engine is placed in forward gear. This is usually caused by one blade of the propeller not opening. Should this occur, slow the engine to idle, shift into reverse gear and accelerate the engine. Idle the engine and shift to forward gear. This should open the offending blade.

Note: When sailing, it is always advisable to start the engine before the sails are lowered. In this way, it is still possible to manoeuvre if the engine should not start. However pay particular attention to sheets and other lines which may be trailing in the water before operating engine and possibly fouling the propeller.
DO NOT OPERATE THE ENGINE WITH SWIMMERS IN THE WATER OR NEARBY! SERIOUS INJURY CAN RESULT.

### 6-10 Engine Shut Down

1. Close the throttle to slow idle.
2. Place the gear shift in neutral.
3. Stop the engine by depressing red stop button on Yanmar panel on SB side of cockpit coaming.
4. Turn engine panel key to OFF.
5. Continue running engine blower for 5 min. (or longer) after engine shutdown to cool down engine compartment and eliminate fumes.
6. If the engine is not to be used again for an extended period, the water intake valve should be closed. **Place start key around valve.**
7. Turn the engine battery switch to OFF.

## 7 PROPANE SYSTEM

### 7-1 Precautions

Correct operation and regular maintenance of the Propane (LPG) system is critical to safety. Obviously the presence of an open flame aboard a yacht presents numerous hazards, from personal injuries, to fire and even explosion. It must be treated with utmost respect. Always be vigilant when operating.

READ CAREFULLY ALL POSTED WARNING PLAQUES AND MANUFACTURER INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED WITH MANUAL PACKAGE!

Propane gas is heavier than air and colourless. As a result any leakage will flow down (towards the bilge) and can occur undetected until it accumulates in sufficient quantities to become a explosion hazard. Therefore the Propane tank is located in a specially engineered locker in the cockpit. This locker is sealed from the interior of the boat and contains a drain hose in the bottom (Propane is heavier than air} which is vented overboard aft where any leaking Propane cannot get back into the yacht. Inside this locker there are two valves to control the flow of LP gas to the stove. One valve is electronically controlled from the panel in the galley, the other is manual and located on the tank itself.

An additional safety feature is a "gas sniffer" device located in the galley connected to an alarm and automatic shutoff.
The drain hose in the Propane tank locker should be checked each time the boat is used. Dirt, leaves, and insects have all been known to clog the drain hose. An easy test is to run a water hose in the Propane locker each time the water tanks are filled or the decks washed and check for adequate drainage. Do not store anything in the locker that could possibly cover or seal the drain, such as cleaning rags, sponges, clothing, sail bags etc. Nothing should be stored in the locker except cans or bottles of volatile solvents or butane and propane canisters.

### 7-2 Stove Operation

1. CHECK THE STOVE AND MAKE SURE ALL BURNER VALVES ARE OFF.
2. Switch on the breaker on the main breaker panel to supply 12 volt DC to the small Propane control panel mounted in the galley.
3. At the Propane tank open the manual valve located on the tank. (Only one turn is necessary.)
4. At the Propane panel, turn on the sniffer by depressing the button depicting a
battery (left). Sniffer will go through a 60 sec. system check before activating the valve, if gas is detected, an alarm will sound and the system will be inoperable.
5. Then depress the button depicting a Propane tank (right button). The LCD will change from an X to a check mark, indicating the system is operational.
6. Light the stove according to the stove manufacturer's instructions.

7-3 System Shutdown:

1. TURN OFF ALL BURNERS
2. Depress the button depicting the Propane tank (right button). The LCD will T
change from a check mark to an X, indicating system gas flow is off.
3. Close manual valve on tank in the Propane locker. ._
4. Leave Propane control panel and sniffer operational when operating boat. Turn off only if you are leaving the boat.

7-4 Leak Testing:

At least once a month, check the Propane system as follows:  
1. Close all burner valves.
2. Activate the entire system as above.
3. Check and note gauge pressure.
4. Close manual valve on tank.
5. Wait 5 minutes and check gauge pressure.
6. If gauge pressure is 90% of original pressure noted in Step 3, system is leak free. Switch off LP controls.
7. If pressure has dropped, then there is a leak. Do not use the system until leak has been detected and eliminated! Gas leaks can be detected by a simple "soap test". This involves brushing a soap solution over all of the joints and fittings in the LP system, with the system activated and looking for small bubbles to appear. All fittings are located inside the LP cockpit locker plus one connection on the rear of the stove.

Use a  solution of 2/3rds liquid dish washing detergent and 1/3rd water.
NEVER USE A MATCH, LIGHTER OR OPEN FLAME TO LOCATE LEAKS! m 7-5 Gas Detector Alarms
The gas detector is effective at sniffing most vapours, volatile or not. The alarm may be caused by something as innocuous as high humidity or cooking steam, NEVER assume an alarm is false. Treat all alarms as significant and run a leak test as above.

### 7-6 Pressure Gauge

The pressure on the gauge does not indicate the quantity of LP remaining in the tank. The gauge is installed as an aid in checking for leakage in the system. Gauge pressure will vary with ambient temperature but is normally in the range 100-150 PSI. To determine the quantity of Propane in the tank, the tank must be weighed and the tare weight (indicated on the tank) subtracted.

## 8 PLUMBING

## 8-1 Domestic Water System

### A. Tanks

Two water tanks (approx. 65 gals each) are located under the port
and starboard main saloon settees. Water tank fills are located on each side
deck. The tanks are controlled by valves located under the main cabin sole. One valve controls each tank as marked. In normal operation one valve should be on and one off, so that as the tank in use runs out you can switch to the other tank by reversing BOTH valves. This gives you some warning about your water usage. If both valves are left open, water can and will run from the windward tank to the leeward tank increasing the heel angle. Furthermore there is the possibility that air will be sucked from the higher tank, making it impossible to obtain water from the lower tank. After initial filling or after switching from one tank to the other, eliminate the air in the plumbing (hot and cold sides) by opening each faucet until there is a steady flow of water. The water pressure pump may run and not shut off unless this is done.

### B. Hot Water Tank

The hot water tank is located in the aft cabin, under the bed. It requires little maintenance other than winterising. Water can be heated by two means:

1. Engine heat exchanger. This is fully automatic. Whenever the engine is running, engine coolant is being circulated through a heat exchanger in the water tank. 20 min. of engine running will usually heat a tank of water. The tank insulation will keep this tank of water (8 gals) hot for many hours, providing hot water for showers or dish washing even at anchor.
2. AC Power: A 120 volt heating element also heats the water, similar to an electric hot water heater at home. Shorepower must be connected or inverter on and the breakers in the proper position on the electrical panel to make hot water. CAUTION: If hot water tank is empty for any reason (such as winterising) DO NOT turn on the electrical breaker. Applying electricity to a dry heating element will burn it out within seconds!

### C. Shower Sumps and Drains

The head sinks, icebox, and showers drain into two sumps located in the bilge in the main cabin and forward stateroom. These sumps contain a float switch and centrifugal pump to evacuate them. The toggles on the main panel are manual on switches (not circuit breakers) which will activate the sump pumps should the float switch not activate the pump when desired. The pumps are separately protected by fuses located in the distribution area under the aft berth.

Because of the nature of the drain water which they handle, the pumps and switches are vulnerable to accumulations of soap scum, hair, and other greasy materials. Occasionally the sumps will require cleaning out. The frequency will vary according to you and your crew's habits. The tops to the sump tanks are easily removed and access to the inside is obtained. Household cleaners will take care of the build up inside. (X-14 Soap Scum Remover works well). When leaving your boat for a prolonged period or after a weekend aboard, run several gallons of fresh water through the drains to help clear the sumps and finish off with a cup of bleach to prevent bacteria growth, mold and odours.

### D. Showers

Are located in both heads. All plumbing hardware is household type and should not present a problem to operate.

The cockpit shower is recessed in two holes covered by plastic caps in the port coaming. One housing contains a telephone-style shower head on a retracting hose. The other contains a mixer faucet with hot and cold water. To turn on the water pull the mixer faucet out to turn on the flow (the button on the shower head must be pressed as well).

Hot and cold mixing is accomplished by turning the mixer handle clockwise or counter clockwise. To turn the faucet off, push in the mixer handle all the way and at the same time release the hose pressure with the shower head button. If you do not release the hose pressure the handle will not remain in a recessed position.

### E. Water Filter

A charcoal/kdf water filter with a replaceable element is installed in line in the cold water line at the galley sink. Only this drinking faucet is double filtered.

### F. Manual Water Pump

A foot-operated water pump is mounted in the galley sole. This pump supplies fresh water to the galley sink faucet, when operating the fresh water pressure pump is not desired. The galley sink faucet must be full on in the cold position for water to flow. A twist of the foot releases and returns the pump to the recessed position.

### 8-2 Seacock Maintenance

Each factory installed seacock is made from a material which allows the valve to be free of corrosion and electrolysis. They require no electrical "bonding".

These valves still require regular inspection and lubrication. Inspect hose clamps carefully. Any rusted clamps should be replaced immediately. All hoses should be fitted with two clamps for redundancy. Activate the handle and lubricate the seals at least twice yearly. A quality waterproof grease or vegetable oil can be used as a lubricant.

### 8-3 Through Hull Installation - AFTERMARKET

Each factory installed seacock or through hull is installed in an area where the core material has been removed to prevent the incursion of water into the core.
Before installing any additional through hulls, the core must be removed in that
area and the area sealed and locally reinforced with additional layers of fibreglass and/or backing plates. We recommend that a skilled professional experienced with cored hull construction install any desired additional through hulls. Please contact our service department for detailed instructions and advice for proper installation.

### 8-4 Bilge Pumps

We are equipped with six bilge pumps. Two are fixed, manual diaphragm pumps, located in the cockpit and below the cabin sole in the main saloon. A third high capacity portable pump and board is mounted just inside the lazaret.

These pumps are rarely used so you should check the operation of each at least once a month. Simply fill the bilge with several gallons of water and pump each. (This is a good practice whenever cleaning the bilge.)

The electric bilge pumps are located in the keel sump and are activated by a float switch. The pump is separately wired to a fuse located under the aft cabin berth. The toggle on the main panel is a manual bypass switch (not a circuit breaker) which will activate the pump should the float switch not activate the pump when desired. Trash can accumulate in the bilge and may be sucked up into the pump body. If the pump runs and does not evacuate the bilge or the flow is reduced, the pump can be removed from its mounting plate by depressing the two small locking tabs at the base of the pump. Check for debris, clean and replace by snapping back into position. See the pump manufacturers instructions. Keep the bilge clean to prevent clogging and also to reduce unpleasant "bilge odour."

### 8-5 Toilets

Refer to the directions supplied by the toilet manufacturer. Most problems experienced with toilets and waste systems are directly a result of what has been put down the toilet. Remember - there are no plumbers at sea! Use only Marine/RV-type toilet tissues designed for holding tank use, and use sparingly. NEVER put tampons, feminine pads, condoms, paper towels, cotton swabs, cigarette butts, candy wrappers or other foreign items down a marine head. Many savvy captains have two strictly enforced rules

1. If you haven't eaten it first, it doesn't go down the toilet. For extreme types that means toilet tissue as well! (A little zip lock bag does the trick quite well).
2. You jam the toilet, you fix it.

Your toilet will love you and your holding tank will go many miles further between pump-outs.
Excessive use of flushing water will increase the need for pump-outs. Conservative use of flushing water is essential. Everyone on board should be instructed in good marine toilet habits.
WARNING: Resistance on the toilet pump handle almost always indicates a full holding tank, (or a closed discharge valve) DO NOT FORCE!!!! Investigate first. Undue force can rupture holding tank cleanout plates or blow off waste hoses.

When leaving the boat for more than a day, we suggest pumping out the holding tanks, flush thoroughly with fresh water, and add some deodorising chemical. Wastes left to "cook" over a period of time will cause an offensive odour in the boat which may be difficult or near impossible to get rid of.

### 8-6 Holding Tanks

The SAGA 43 has one complete waste systems which are designed to be legal in any location. Waste may be held in holding tanks until a dockside pump out station is reached; or waste in holding tanks may be evacuated overboard by on-board electric macerator pumps, where legal; or waste may be discharged directly overboard from the toilets, where legal.

### 8-7 Y-Valve

Each toilet discharge hose is connected to a Y-valve which can be selected to m either divert waste into the holding tank or discharge it directly overboard through a seacock (in which case the overboard discharge seacock must also
be open). The Y-valve is conveniently located near each toilet and is clearly T
marked. In some jurisdictions, this valve may be illegal unless secured in the I tank position. In such a case you may drill a small hole through the longer end of
the valve handle (with the handle in the tank position) and into the fibreglass T
moulding directly beneath. Insert a #8 machine screw (1 1/2" long) through the --' handle and secure with a nyloc nut on the back side. In addition you may be
required to secure the overboard discharge seacock in some fashion (don't drill T a hole as above, the sea is out there!). ->

### 8-8 Macerator

Your SAGA holding tank is equipped with a macerator pump to discharge
overboard the wastes that have accumulated in the holding tank when you
sailing where it is legal to do so. The pump discharges waste through its own seacock after chopping up solid waste into fine particles.
To operate: 1 1. Open the macerator discharge seacock. Only open this seacock when
actually using the Macerator pump. Seawater can leak back into holding tank if 1 the seacock is left open.
2. Turn on the proper breaker switch on the main electrical panel. You will hear the pump run and as it sucks in the waste the pitch will drop as it begins
pumping. When the pitch increases again the tank is empty. Repeat for each
holding tank. 3. It is a good idea at this time to manually pump the toilet 20-30 strokes with the water intake valve open to flush clean seawater into the tank.
Run the macerator again until empty. Add some deodoriser chemicals in the toilet and pump several strokes into the holding tank.
4. Close macerator discharge seacock.
P59
 0f

### 8-9 Deck Pumpout
Each holding tank has a deck fitting for use at a dockside facility. The dockside
facility will have an adapter fitting which screws into the deck plate to adapt their suction hose. Your dock attendant will be able to assist you. It is a good idea to flush plenty of fresh water through the toilet or into the deck plate to help rinse out the tank. Add some commercial tank chemical afterwards. Your olfactory senses will appreciate it too. Never leave the boat with waste in the holding
tanks.

## 9 ELECTRICAL

9-1 General

The electrical system in your SAGA Yacht has been designed to ensure trouble free operation. Wiring and connections are kept as high in the interior of the yacht as practicable, reducing the possibility of exposure to water. The main switch panels are located to protect them from the elements.
The electrical circuits are numbered at convenient locations at the panel and throughout the yacht. A numbering scheme and diagram is located in this manual for your convenience.

9-2 AC Transfer Switch

The main panel contains a special main breaker switch with slide bars that selects the source of incoming 120V AC, which may be from dockside power, the Inverter, or optional AC generator.

9-3 Using the shore power cord.

1. Set breaker for inverter to OFF position after switching OFF all AC breakers.
2. Connect cord to shore power receptacle on shore first before connecting cord to inlet on the yacht.
3. Connect cord to boat.
4. Check polarity indicator on main panel. If lit, the polarity on shore power receptacle could be reversed, or there may be an open ground connection to shore. Disconnect from shore power immediately— a serious hazard may exist.
Get help from Marina or an electrician before reconnecting to that dockside outlet again.
6. If polarity indicator is OK, then switch main breaker to shore power position and switch on any other AC circuit you wish to use.

9-4 Charging batteries with shore power

1. Make sure switch on AC main panel marked "inverter" is in the OFF position.
2. Set switch marked "Battery Charger" on the AC side of the main panel to the
ON position, (there is a built-in delay in the Freedom unit, battery charging will
begin about 20 seconds after activated.)
3. When the inverter is operating in battery charging mode, DC is being supplied
to your batteries and also to run any 12V DC loads at the same time. Battery
voltage and charging amperage being supplied by the unit is indicated on the inverter panel.
Caution
Shut down battery charging before starting engine. Do not charge batteries
using the inverter while the engine is running, as the alternator on the engine is charging the batteries at this time.
rj

9-5 Inverter operation:

The inverter converts 12 volt DC current from the batteries into 120 volt AC household type current for operation of small appliances. Induction type AC electrical devices such as hair dryers, toasters, small electric heaters should not be used with an inverter. Their loads are extremely high and rapid discharge of the batteries will result. Small TVs, radios, blenders, mixers, battery chargers for cell phones or handheld VHF's and computers do however work well. Except for brief periods, operation of the microwave and other high load devices is only recommended when engine is running.

1. Disconnect shore power cord.
2. Set Main House battery switch to ON
3. Set "battery charger" breaker to OFF position 4. Set "inverter" switch to ON position.
5. Set main AC breaker switch to Inverter position.
6. Select AC load as desired. Note: there must be a load on the inverter for 120V to indicate on the AC meter.
The system is set-up so that the air conditioning and hot water tank will function when the inverter is being used. This will allow the inverter to supply power when there is excess solar. See the inverter owners manual supplied for detailed instructions and other cautions.

9-6 Courtesy lights:

The courtesy floor lights are powered directly from the batteries and protected by a separate fuse located under aft cabin berth. When the main battery power switch is turned off, the courtesy lights will still have power available so that as you enter the boat you can turn the courtesy lights on for a safe lighted entry before turning on the main battery switch. There are two switches to control the lights, one near the companionway and another in the master stateroom. A red light near the cockpit engine panel indicates if courtesy lights have inadvertently been left on. Be sure to check it before leaving the boat for long periods.

9-7 Batteries

There are many possible options in the battery setup on your SAGA Yacht. The standard equipment is two gel-cell 4D batteries for "house" service and a single #27 gel-cell battery for engine starting purposes.

9-8 Alternator

All engines are equipped with the standard alternator as supplied by the engine manufacturer. High output alternators may be fitted as an option. Check manuals supplied.

9-9 Electric Winch

Your SAGA is fitted with an electric-powered self-tailing winch for hoisting and
reefing the mainsail. It must be used with special care. Personal injury and damage to the boat can result from improper operation. Do not allow children to operate. Only properly instructed adults should be allowed to operate it. Do not wear loose clothing which could possibly be tangled in the mechanism when operating or standing nearby.
While very handy and a big energy saver, it is difficult for an operator to judge
just how much pressure is being applied to the line on the winch. The winch is
powerful enough to rip the headboard out of a sail. Therefore we recommend that the electric power be operated for all but the last couple inches and then
switch to manual power with a conventional handle to "sweat up" the last inches.
To operate the winch, set the breaker on the main panel to ON to supply 12V to the winch relays. The winch is a two speed unit. The switches for each speed are mounted on the cabin house. The winch motor is fused by a 130A breaker
m,
located in line and an overload breaker in the aft cabin. For safety reasons, the
electric motor is automatically deactivated whenever a winch handle is inserted
in the winch socket.

9-10 Electric Windlass

An electric anchor windlass is an available option. Mounted on the foredeck, the 1 two foot switches control up and down direction as indicated on switch under the * covers. The same cautions mentioned above for the electric winch (Sec. 9-9) _
apply to the windlass. ]
To operate the windlass, the breaker (marked "Winch" and same one as above) m on the main panel supplying 12V DC to the relays must be ON. The windlass is protected by a 150A BUSS fuse in line, mounted under the aft berth. The relay
switch box and an overload breaker is located high in the forepeak. Because of
the high DC load it is desirable to operate the windlass only with the engine
running.
Do not use the windlass to "break-out" an anchor. Transfer the anchor rode load
to a mooring cleat and use the engine power to break out. Always transfer anchor load to a cleat whenever anchored. DO NOT use the anchor windlass (if
fitted) as a cleat or bollard.
See the windlass instructions for details on proper operation and selection of
rope and chain sizes to fit the gypsy. Proper matching of rope, chain and gypsy T is critical for safe effective operation. 3
9-11 Navigation Lights T The Navigation lights are controlled by breakers on the Main Panel. The lights
you show other craft signify your legal status and affect your right of way rights.
Learn what each of the lights means on your own boat as well as the many light configurations on various other types of craft.
(I

Show the following lights, whenever operating as a powerboat. That is: any time the engine is propelling the vessel, even if sails are raised and drawing. If you are running the engine for battery charging and it is not in gear the following
does not apply.
1. Red and Green sidelights (on bow rail) 2. White stern light (on stern rail) 3. White bow light (on forward face of mast; although located at half height of the mast this light is legally designated the "masthead" light)
#1 & #2 above are on a single breaker marked "Navigation lights" #3 is on the (Wl breaker marked "Steaming light"
When SAILING: same as above except turn off #3 (White bow light) to indicate you are operating as a sailboat.
When operating as a sailboat only, you may chose to use the combination Tri colour light (Red, Green, and White) at the masthead. Even though located on the top of the mast, this is not the "masthead" light
DO NOT USE the Tri-colour light simultaneously with any other navigation lights or whenever operating propulsion machinery.
When at anchor, where required, show the 360 degree white light on top of the mast.

MBit
The compass light has a separate cockpit mounted switch in addition to the panel breaker to switch on when desired.
Carry spare light bulbs. Always check navigation lights before leaving the dock or mooring, even if you do not expect to stay out after dusk. You may be
unexpectedly delayed.
Refer to USCG Publication #CG-169 RULES OF THE ROAD (COLREGS) for more information on lights and navigation rules.
9-12 ELECTRONICS Introduction
Many owners add electronic equipment such as knotmeters, distance logs,
depth sounders, (all of which usually require through hull fittings) and relative wind indicators, wind speed indicators, VHF, SSB radios as well as various
types of electronic navigation aids such as Loran and GPS. A limited list of electronics items may be factory installed while the yacht is being built, however
most are usually installed by the SAGA Yachts Dealer or a local technician during the make ready/commissioning process.
Problems can develop in electronic instrumentation due to faulty installation. Aftermarket electronics should be installed only by a qualified specialist. If you
experience problems with your electronics, first contact the installing technician who actually performed the original installation.

It is not feasible to calibrate or compensate factory-installed electronics (or
compasses) at the SAGA factory. It is customary to have your dealer perform T calibration and compensation during commissioning. Usually there is an *
additional labour charge for this service.
9-12a Through Hull Fittings
If other than standard through hull fittings are required and are to be added after ,*
the yacht is built, consult your SAGA Marine Dealer or SAGA's service
department to determine the correct positioning of the through hull fitting.
Directions concerning the components and installation of the through hull fittings should be supplied with the unit. Remember that the hull contains core material. Refer to Sec. 8-3.
9-12b Masthead Fittings Masthead fittings should be installed carefully, following manufacturers recommendations. Your SAGA mast contains an internal wiring conduit, all  cables must be fed through the conduit to prevent chafing and tangling with the internal halyards and other cordage. Cables leading from the masthead fitting
exit the mast above the cabin sole and enter the bulkhead into the forward  stateroom under the berth as provided for mast light wiring. A connector should
be installed at this point which facilitates easy disconnecting whenever the mast
is unstepped. Keep all connectors, junctions and wiring as high in the yacht as ( possible to prevent them from coming in contact with bilge water. -
9-12 Electronic Equipment
All electronic equipment serviced by the yacht's 12 volt electric circuit should be
separately protected by a fuse or circuit breaker of appropriate size. If a large  number of electronics are to be added, a branch panel of breakers may be ]
required. Make sure that the polarity for electronic accessories is correct, and
that they are installed according to the manufacturer's recommendation. .
9-12d Magnetic & Fluxgate Compasses
Magnetic compasses are adversely affected by electromagnetic waves  generated by electrical equipment as well as by large metallic objects. The pedestal steering compass supplied with your boat must be checked and re- compensated after the final installation of all aftermarket electronic gear.
It. has not been factory compensated.
All compasses have some error, called deviation, which will vary at different
headings. We recommend that the compensation procedure (called "swinging the ship") be performed only by a competent professional who can supply you
with a deviation table for any remaining compass error that cannot be removed
by the internal compensation magnets. Furthermore deviation should be determined with engine running and not running; and with major electronics both
on and off to check for their effect on deviation.
 /K)

An electronic fluxgate compass is similarly affected by metallic objects and
nearby electronics, just like the steering compass. Your autopilot manual gives P instructions on swinging the ship and built-in compensation techniques.
SPI
Be very careful never to store tools, canned goods, or other heavy metal objects within 3 feet of the compasses on board. Stereo speakers and portable radios are a particularly strong magnetic source. Even a beer or soda can stored in a pedestal mounted drink holder may affect the steering compass. Be vigilant at
all times about the storage and the installation of additional electronic gear.

10-2 Additional Equipment Recommendations

The International Sailing Federation Offshore Racing Council's SPECIAL REGULATIONS governing offshore racing are a good starting point forguidelines as to equipping your yacht. For offshore cruising, a yacht should be
equipped to Category One requirements as a minimum standard. This publication may be purchased from your national sailing association.
Life Jackets (PFDs)  The wearing of a PFD by competent swimmers in benign conditions should {
never be considered "sissy-fied" and is highly recommended at all times when
underway. Non-swimmers should always wear a PFD at anytime on deck, even  at the dock. It is prudent practice to attach a whistle and small personal strobe light to each wearable PFD. For sailors who feel that the traditional bulky life
jacket will hinder their movement about the boat, inflatable PFDs are now on the  market, while CG approved models are preferred, other models will still provide . I
more safety than wearing no flotation.
In addition, an approved "throwable device" is usually required to be carried ? near the helmsman or on deck. Many very effective "man-overboard devices"
are NOT USCG approved. Make sure you have an approved device in addition 1 to the non-approved but desirable device. '
Life Buoys
PS
Many yachts carry life buoys or "man-overboard poles" which can be stowed in a * bracket on the stern or adjacent to the helmsman. These life buoys should have
a gravity-activated strobe or other bright light attached, along with a long line which connects to a man-overboard pole. This pole is typically stored near the
transom and would go overboard along with the buoy and light. The assembly m facilitates spotting the person to whom the buoy has been launched in any type
of sea or visibility conditions.
Safety Harnesses Just as with life jackets, a safety harness should always be worn by crew
members on deck in all but the calmest conditions. Harnesses allow the wearer to be attached to some permanent fixture on or above the deck. They should be ! of good quality and capable of carrying the full weight of the wearer falling
several feet. There are padeyes mounted in the cockpit and on deck specifically m> for this purpose. Additionally, removable nylon web strap jacklines are supplied with your SAGA which will allow the crew to manoeuvre on deck without
detaching the harness tether line. CAUTION: Nylon degrades when exposed to T UV light over a period of time. Be sure to remove the jacklines between '
passages or whenever the jacklines are not being used. Inspect them regularly
and replace the web straps if any sign of degradation is observed. nq
 $PFlashlights
The yacht should be equipped with several water-proof flashlights, routinely
checked to be in good condition with well charged batteries. Flashlights serve as a convenience at night while moving about the yacht and in trimming sails as
well as a safety measure. They may also be used for attracting attention as well as locating a person overboard.
Radar Reflectors
The fibreglass sailboat may not create a distinctive return on another vessel's
radar, therefore a radar reflector is a must. The radar reflector should be stored

0 carefully to prevent damage as the performance of the unit is directly related to the accuracy of the intersecting angles of the component planes. When
mounted, the reflector should be carried as high as possible on your boat. Often, a flag halyard is used to hold a reflector just below one of the spreaders. Some
types of reflectors may be mounted permanently on the mast or one of the stays.
Dinghy or Life Raft
Your yacht has a locker intended for a valise-type life raft on the starboard side
of the cockpit. Most modern 6 person life rafts will fit in the locker; however, be sure the one you contemplate buying will fit before spending your money.
The modern inflatable dinghy is a great convenience while cruising, but is of
limited use in an emergency situation. Inflatable craft should be thoroughly
checked every year to ensure safe and proper operation. Life rafts should be
inflated, inspected, repacked and certified on a regular basis. Your SAGA Yachts Dealer can advise you where such inspections are offered in your locale.
10-3 Lifelines
The life lines aboard your yacht should be checked daily to ensure their
integrity. Always close the access gates before leaving the dock. On longer offshore passages, the gates' pelican hooks are best taped over to prevent
accidental opening. Check carefully that the swage end fittings are not pulling out and that the lock nuts on the tumbuckles are tight. Cotter pins (not "ring-
dings") should be fitted and taped over for protection from chafe and personal
injury. Do Not allow crew members to sit on the lifelines as it damages the wires where they pass through the stanchions.
10-4 Anchors & Anchoring
Your yacht is equipped with two large anchor handling rollers on the bowsprit and a large, divided, rope/chain locker low in the forepeak. Since all of the factory supplied components are generously-sized, it is tempting to overload the bow. In a quest for a high confidence level when anchored. Many sailors ignore the negative effects of an overloaded bow on the flotation level and trim of the yacht; this in turn has an adverse effect on performance, comfort, and even safety when one encounters heavy weather.


There are several strategies to use to reduce the overall weight of your '
anchoring system and increase its efficiency for certain conditions. The following
list of equipment may not be entirely suitable for your cruising style or locale. T
1. Use only modern lightweight anchors with high 'Holding Power to Weight'
ratios. Some of the new aluminum lightweights are especially effective in 1 sand and mud bottom conditions.
2. Use high-tensile chain of a size or two smaller than that required of BBB or
proof coil chain. Tests show that modern burying type anchors can actually dig deeper into the sea bottom with a smaller diameter HT chain thereby
increasing holding power of the overall system. Avoid the "belt and i+
suspenders" temptation of using the same size HT chain as you would for BBB. The system is only as strong as its weakest link, which will usually be
the holding power of the anchor itself. 5/16" HT chain has a working load
twice that of 5/16" BBB and a third greater than 3/8" BBB. In fact 1/4" HT chain has a working load roughly equal to 3/8" BBB.
3. Store the "storm anchor" which will be rarely used, aft and low under the
cockpit. Your back will appreciate two smaller anchors forward. ! 4. Avoid full chain rodes. 10-15 fathoms of chain on your primary anchor
should suffice for chafe protection on coral or rocky bottoms. The elasticity of  a nylon rode is beneficial as it tends to prevent jerking the anchor out in a '
heavy surge. Nylon is much quieter and much easier on the hands. A nylon
rode will reset easier than all-chain after a major wind shift. Nylon is also more environmentally friendly to coral and sub-aquatic vegetation. ' 5. Practice technique. Anchoring is a learned skill. No amount of chain or
anchors aboard your yacht will substitute for poor anchoring technique. The following anchor combination weighs in at under 225 lbs. It may not be
entirely appropriate for your conditions. The type and quantity of anchors you i,
ultimately choose will vary from region to region according to the sea bottom and
local conditions. Each anchor should include an adequate size and length of line
along with a length of chain to ensure that the anchor lies properly and penetrates the bottom as well as protecting the line from chafe on the seabed.
35 lb. plow (Bruce, CQR, or Delta) & 30 ft. of 1/4" HT Chain spliced to 200 ft. i 9/16" Nylon, (substituting a Danforth 20H or Fortress FX23 may increase
holding power and versatility on muddy bottoms and reduce overall weight  about 15 lbs.) 45 lb. plow (Bruce, CQR or Delta) & 60 ft. of 5/16" HT Chain spliced to 200 ft.
5/8" Nylon.
An electric windlass which handles a specially spliced rope/chain rode is
optional. Make sure your windlass gypsy and the anchor rode and chain are
correctly matched to each other and a proper splice connects them, for smooth <-, operation.
After the anchor is laid out with sufficient scope for the depth of water, cleat the anchor rode and back down on the anchor with the engine at approximately 2000 RPM in reverse. Watch for dragging. If you drag, retrieve the anchor and
try again.
There is no agreement in boating on any single anchoring technique or
anchoring equipment. Although we offer one possible combination of anchoring
equipment, other sources may provide you with differing recommendations. Talk to other boat owners in your area, take courses with the Power Squadron, Coast
Guard Auxiliary or an accredited sailing school
10-5 Gasoline Storage
Gasoline vapours are explosive in the right concentrations and heavier than air.
Improper storage of the dinghy's outboard gasoline supply is extremely hazardous. We have provided a special locker in the cockpit near the transom
door designed to hold a standard 6 gal outboard tank. The locker is vented
overboard and sealed from the bilge according to USCG guidelines. This is a p unique SAGA feature. Please use it for your safety.
NEVER STORE GASOLINE IN A SAIL LOCKER OR BELOW DECKS

11 MAINTENANCE

Keeping a yacht shipshape and in good order, requires maintenance on a
regular and frequent basis. The frequency will depend upon the conditions under which the yacht is being used. You must continually check the running
and standing rigging, winches, engine, bilge and head as well as surface finishes for signs of deterioration and neglect. Deck hardware should be washed down with fresh water after sailing in salt water. This is particularly true of roller
furling gear; and main and jib sheet traveler cars which have ball bearings that should be flushed out with fresh water regularly to operate smoothly. Be careful
to use only biodegradable and environmentally friendly products for the maintenance of your yacht, if there is any possibility that any residue might come in contact with the water.
11-1 Gelcoat Surfaces
Wash down the gelcoat surface of the hull and the deck regularly with fresh water and a good biodegradable detergent. Do not use abrasive cleaners. A
sponge or soft brush should be used on smooth surfaces, while a stiffer brush
may be used on the non-skid areas of the deck. Follow by thoroughly rinsing with fresh water.
At least once a year the topsides of the hull should be waxed with a high quality automotive or boat wax, then polished. This will help the gelcoat retain its colour and appearance. Do not wax the non-skid surfaces of the deck.
Minor scratches in gelcoat surfaces can be repaired by rubbing with a light abrasive buffing compound followed by polishing and waxing. Scrapes or
damage that has broken through the gelcoat surface can be repaired with the gelcoat repair kit which is provided with your yacht. For major damage, where a large area of the gelcoat has been removed, or where the damage extends into the glass lamination below the gelcoat, consult your SAGA Marine Dealer or a
qualified marine repair facility.
Gelcoat surfaces below deck should be cleaned with a good detergent and
water, then rinsed with fresh water. These surfaces may also be waxed to maintain the appearance. Be careful about applying wax to surfaces that can be
walked upon.
The head sinks are fibreglass and should be maintained with the same care as other gelcoat surfaces.
Gelcoat surfaces will stain if the yacht is moored where tree leaves may fall on deck or in areas where birds roost. Under these conditions, surfaces should be scrubbed down frequently. A protective cover will offer protection and reduce
maintenance.


11-2 Windows and Hatches
Windows and hatches of your yacht are glazed with acrylic which is impact-
resistant and very durable. However, the surface of the acrylic is not abrasion
resistant, and therefore, gritty cleaning agents should never be used on them. Clean the ports with mild soap and water. DO NOT USE AMMONIA BASED
CLEANERS. They can "cloud" acrylic. If the ports require polishing, acrylic polish is available from most major hardware dealers. Rinse afterward with mild soap and water.
As time goes on, the neoprene seal in the hatches will compress and the hatch
may begin to leak. This may be corrected by adjusting the handle assemblies. The life of the seals will be prolonged if regularly cleaned of salt residue and
treated with Armor-All® or a similar product.
Eventually the seals on the hatches may need replacing with parts which can be obtained by contacting SAGA Yachts.
NOTE: Never apply undue force to a hatch when closing. Do not allow a hatch to fall back to an unsupported position as the leverage could shear the hinge lugs.
COMPLETELY CLOSE FORWARD HATCHES WHENEVER SAILING. JIB SHEETS CAN BE CAUGHT IN AN OPEN OR PARTIALLY OPEN HATCH WHEN MANOEUVERING UNDER SAIL. THIS MAY SEVERELY DAMAGE THE
HATCH.
11-3 Hull below the Waterline
The gelcoat used on your SAGA Yacht is premium grade ISO-NPG polyester
resin gelcoat. The gelcoat is further backed up by several laminates of vinylester resin. This combination has proven to be highly blister resistant. The use of an
epoxy-type undercoating is not necessary or recommended. There is little evidence that these types of coatings actually increase blistering resistance. In
fact, blistering of the applied coating itself or adhesion failure of the barrier coating may be far more likely to occur than blistering of the ISO-NPG gelcoat.
The effectiveness of gelcoat can be seriously damaged by improper application
of antifouling and barrier coatings. The hardest, densest, and most impervious
part of the hull structure is the very outer surface of the gelcoat. (only several molecules deepJAny aggressive sanding of the surface, or use of strong paint
stripping chemicals or primers which are designed to act by way of softening the gelcoat surface will seriously reduce the long term blister resistance of the hull.
11-3a Application of antifouling on bare hull:
Because this initial coating serves as the foundation for subsequent seasonal
applications of bottom paint, it is extremely important that the coatings be the best quality and that they be applied carefully and strictly according to their
manufacturer's instructions. Thereafter, the routine maintenance of the bottom will be much easier with the best possible results.
1*9
Wj
 ps
03?)
NOTE: The following instructions dictate the use of, and exposure to, potentially
dangerous chemicals which may be harmful to you, your health, and the environment if not used carefully. They are best handled by a skilled
professional. If you are attempting a "do-it-yourself job, please carefully read all
product information, health warnings and cautions supplied by the manufacturer before beginning.
1. Wash off all road grime that may be left on the hull from trucking with a strong
grease-cutting detergent such as 409® or Simple Green®. Then thoroughly remove all wax from hull surface below the waterline with INTERLUX 202®
solvent wash, using lots of fresh clean rags (discard rags only in an approved manner, spontaneous combustion and/or health and environmental damage can
result). Do not skimp on this step.
2. The bottom should be lightly sanded with a "DA" type sander using 120 paper.
The gelcoat must not be aggressively sanded with belt sanders or disc grinders as they offer little control and the gelcoat can be quickly damaged. Any sanding that cuts through the gelcoat to the laminate below will void the hull blistering
warranty policy.
3. Mask hull at waterline. Apply INTERLUX AL 200® primer according to
manufacturers instructions. (Note: the window of time AL 200 primer is allowed
to dry before application of antifouling is critical to adhesion quality.)
4. Apply two or three coats of a premium quality hard finish antifouling paint.
Epoxy based paints such as Interlux Super Bottomkote® or Woolsey Supertox® make a fine base for future coats to be applied in subsequent seasons.
The frequency and amount of maintenance required on the bottom is governed
by the nature of the water in which the yacht is kept, and to some extent, by the use it gets. If the waters are polluted or are conducive to marine growth, it may
be necessary to have the bottom cleaned one or more times during the sailing season by a bottom cleaning service. If for any reason the yacht is hauled and it is planned to keep it out of the water for any length of time, the bottom should be scrubbed down immediately before any marine growth dries and hardens upon the bottom. You may lightly sand old antifouling prior to a fresh new coat each
season, but avoid sanding down to bare gelcoat.
> IfllSl

11-4 Cove Stripe
fi The cove stripe (just below the deck line) and SAGA logos are coloured mylar
tape. The cove stripe may be cleaned by using mild detergent solution. The
mylar tape and logo, if needing replacement, can be purchased through your SAGA Yachts Dealer. Be very careful when using power buffers and polishers
on the hull not to run across the cove stripe. The mylar can be smeared or burned by power buffers.
f$m\

11-5 Vinyl Rub Rail The vinyl rub rail is located along the gunwale where the deck is attached to the
hull. This rub rail may be cleaned using detergent and water. If hard to remove  stains are found, a good quality marine cleaner, formulated for vinyl may be ' required." Armor-All®" or a similar product is excellent treatment for the vinyl. It
leaves a shine and protects it from the UV and the elements. 11-6 Standing Rigging _
Standing rigging is defined as those fixed parts of the rigging which support the 1 mast. The standing rigging should be visually checked each time before going
sailing and given a detailed examination semi annually. Tumbuckles should be  inspected to make sure that cotter pins are in place at top and bottom, that cotter
pin ends are turned back carefully and that they are covered with plastic tape.
Each spreader should be checked that the pins are properly in place and to m ensure that the spreader is not out of alignment. The end of the spreader where the shroud passes through should be padded with a piece of foam and taped
over or leathered to prevent chafing sails.
1X19 wire rigging should be checked for broken, protruding strands. Check
also for any signs of rust on wire rigging. A good practice is to paint a small white ring around the wire where it enters the terminal. The paint will show if any '
slippage occurs and will prevent salt from collecting in the minute spaces
between the strands which will induce corrosion. Examine carefully where the T
wire enters the terminal end fitting for signs of rust or wear since this is a '
particularly vulnerable point when the yacht is sailed in salt water. Rod rigging if
fitted should be examined for nicks or kinks and any signs of fatigue where the rod enters the terminal end fitting. If a potential problem is found, consult your * SAGA Marine Dealer or a professional rigger. _
11-7 Running Rigging
Running rigging consists of the lines that are normally used in handling and
trimming sails such as sheets, guys, halyards and vangs. Main and Genoa
halyards are subject to heavy loading and constant flexing as they pass over the
sheaves at the head of the mast and turning blocks at the foot of the mast. Over
a period of time, the constant flexing and exposure to weather tends to fatigue ' the material. Halyards should be examined regularly for signs of stress, chafe or
wear. When such signs appear, the halyard should be replaced. The main  halyard shackle should be checked each time the yacht is sailed to ensure it 1 closes and locks smoothly and securely. The shackle's eye splice should also
be checked with each sail. The genoa and jib should be lowered two or three  times per sailing season in order to inspect their respective halyards. The >
headsail halyard shackles require seizing to ensure accidental opening.
Rope sheets tend to fray over a period of time and they are also affected by T sunlight; this causes a reduction in strength. Sheets should be replaced when * any strand of the outer layer of braid is broken. To minimise the chance of
damaged jib/genoa sheets, be aware of potential chafe points when sailing and T cover all sharp edges with rigging tape. Thoroughly rinse the sheets with fresh
water after salt water sails as the salt crystals will abrade the fibres over time.

During winter storage, remove all lines from the boat and store in a dry place. Dacron lines may be washed in your home washing machine by placing them in
a pillow case or string bag, using cold water on "Gentle" cycle and hanging to
dry. DO NOT dry them in your clothes dryer.
Replace your rope halyards with light messenger cord when storing your boat
during the winter months. This applies even when the mast is removed from the boat for separate, covered storage.
11-8 Lifelines, Pulpits and Stanchions
Lifelines, like standing rigging, should receive regular, periodic inspections. The terminal ends at the tumbuckles must be well screwed into the barrel in order that all the threads of barrel are fully engaged. Any lock nuts must be done up
tightly and use of 'Loc-Tite®" is recommended. All clevis pins should be secured with correct size cotter pins and taped over to prevent damage to sails or
personal injury:
NOTE: the vendors of lifeline parts often supply clevis pins with "ring-dings." For added security, SAGA Marine recommends that cotter pins be substituted for ring-dings in lifeline components. Tape over all sharp edges for safety.

r
consult with a skilled rigger or replace immediately.
fiW
Check pulpits, stanchions, and stanchion bases for dents or cracks. Ensure that
they are properly secured to their bases. A slight "wobble" in the stanchion caused by clearance in the stanchion base is normal and desirable. The
clearance is manufacturing tolerance designed to reduce the possibility of crevice corrosion (and eventual seizing) between the cast aluminum base
housing and the stainless steel stanchion. When washing down the boat be sure to flush out stanchion bases with fresh water to wash out any salt which hastens
corrosion.
Don't allow crew to sit or stand on the lifelines at any time.
11-9 Winches and Blocks
Most problems which develop in winches are due to insufficient or improper maintenance. Consult your winch manufacturer's owner's manual. With continuous sailing in salt water, winches should be stripped down, cleaned and lubricated once a month. In fresh water areas this maintenance procedure should be performed at least twice each season. The bolts securing the winches should be checked at least once each season. Bolts securing the winches on the coach roof may be checked by removing the access covers located in the head liner of the aft cabin and by removing the microwave oven in the galley. If it is necessary to remove a winch base and remove the bolts, the bolts should be resealed with polysulfide marine sealant.
Check the swaged ends of lifeline wires for signs of rust. Inspect swage fittings with a magnifying glass for cracks at least semi annually. Cracks are a sign of internal crevice corrosion and may not be easily visible. If cracks are present
 |  Blocks normally require little maintenance, but they should be examined i
regularly for damage, particularly at the shackle connection. Never leave a snatch block open, and be sure the latch is properly closed before applying load
so that the cheek of the block will not be bent.
We recommend flushing out ball bearing blocks with fresh water after each use.
Sheaves and blocks can be sprayed with a DRY silicone or DRY Teflon®
lubricant to keep them running freely.(lubricants which attract dirt should not be
used}. The sheaves at the head of the mast should be checked before the spar
goes into the yacht at commissioning. The sheaves for the main and genoa
halyards have oil-lite bronze bushings and normally do not require lubrication, but once each season, a few drops of light machine oil will be adequate. All
running rigging should be washed down with fresh water after sailing in salt water.

### 11-10 Engine

The maintenance of your engine is covered in the engine manufacturer's
Owner's Manual which should be read carefully. ]
11-11 Power Train  Details of shaft alignment and maintenance of the stuffing box are given in * Section 5.
I 11-12 Electrical The electrical wiring should require little or no maintenance. Exposed terminals
and connections should be checked several times each season, more frequently
in salt water environment. Check for looseness of the connections, tighten as needed, and the presence of any corrosion on the terminals or connecting posts. Connections may be protected with a light application of an appropriate spray coating obtainable from an electronics parts supplier.
"Clean, Dry, Tight" are the three most important factors in battery and electrical maintenance.

### 11-13 Upholstery

The cushions and seat backs on your SAGA Yacht are covered with stain- I
resistant fabric which is easy to care for. It is important that the upholstery be
kept aired and that it be dried after use to prevent mold development. If the
yacht is to be left unused for prolonged periods, it is advisable to stand the 3 cushions on end so that air can circulate around them. It is also advisable at
such times to clean out all lockers, removing all dampness and leaving locker  doors open. During winter storage, we recommend that you remove the cushions * from the boat and store them in a clean, dry area.

11-14 Steering

The manufacturer's instructions for maintaining your pedestal steering system should be followed closely. Your SAGA Yacht has Whitlock rod steering.

The roller bearings in the pedestal were lubricated by the manufacturer during assembly. After each season, apply lubrication in the holes provided on top of each bearing. Do not over lubricate as it will affect the brake pads. Check periodically to prevent the bearings running dry and lubricate following the
 manufacturer's recommendation.
Lightly oil the roller chain every two months with machine oil. Oil the sheave p bearings in the holes provided, four times each season.
Inspect and lightly oil the cables in the system. The manufacturer recommends
 placing about five layers of facial tissue in the palm of your gloved hand, I applying oil to the tissues and lightly rubbing the wire. This will lubricate the
strands and "flag" a broken or hooked strand by tearing the tissue. If there is a
 break in the wire, replace it immediately. Cover your hand with a thick leather i glove to prevent injury during this check.

In the event of a failure in the pedestal steering system, such as a loss of a cable, there is an emergency tiller supplied with your yacht. (The optional
jp electronic autopilot is connected to the rudder post with a separate steering arm I from the pedestal and in most cases will steer the yacht in the event of a failure
in the pedestal.) The emergency tiller connects directly to the rudder post
p without tools. To install, remove the cover plate at the rear of the cockpit and inset tiller. Steering will be less cumbersome if you then remove the steering
wheel (be careful that you do not lose the metal shaft key when you take off the p wheel). Lines can be attached to the tiller and run outboard to assist in steering.
The Whitlock steering system needs little maintenance other than periodic f> inspection of the ball joints to ensure the connecting bolts are secure.
The underside of the steering pedestal should be inspected for evidence of
p water leaks. The complete system, including attaching bolts should be inspected l each season.

11-15 Deck Fittings

Any deck fitting which is under load (chain plates, genoa tracks, line stoppers,
etc.) should be checked on a regular basis and re-bedded with marine sealant if found to be leaking. The chainplates are fitted with an "escutcheon plate" which
retains the caulk between the deck and chainplate. The highly loaded chainplate

moves minutely during normal use. Eventually the caulk seal with the chainplate will be lost and some leaking will occur. This is particularly true during the first
months of use as the chainplates "bed-in" during initial use.
Should a leak occur, remove the escutcheon plate by backing out the fixing screws on deck and lift as high as tumbuckle above it allows. Clean out the old caulking with a penknife, wipe area with mineral spirits and apply a bead of
polysulfide caulk (LifeCaulk®) beneath the escutcheon plate along both sides of the chainplate. Gently lower the escutcheon plate and fit the screws. Do not fully tighten the screws as this will squeeze out the caulking, (leave an 1/8 turn) Clean up excess caulk with mineral spirits.

### 11-16 Roller Furling

The bearings in your roller furling gear need no lubrication. They should be
regularly flushed out with fresh water and mild detergent to remove salt and dirt. Lower the sails frequently and flush out both lower unit and top swivel. An amazing amount of salt (and bird droppings) can accumulate in the bearings of the top swivel. Dry lubricants which do not attract dirt may be used. Foils may be sprayed with dry silicone to ease raising and lowering sails. Inspect swage fittings, shackles, and the lower tumbuckle assembly for signs of corrosion or fatigue at least twice a season.

### 11-17 Keel Bolt Torque

It is recommended the keel bolts be retorqued before each sailing season
begins. Contact our service department for torque specifications.
Since the keel is attached to the hull with mechanical fastenings (bolts), and due to loads imposed upon the keel during sailing, it is not unusual to see a line of
separation at the keel/hull joint after the boat has been hauled.

### Water System

Water tanks are located beneath each main saloon settee. Access to tank and clean-out ports requires removal of screws on berth flats and lee-cloths. Capacity is approximately 65 gallons each. The manifold valves controlling the tanks are located under the main cabin sole, immediately aft of the dining table.

Prior to initial usage, during commissioning, the potable water tanks should be flushed with hot (if possible) water to remove manufacturing residue and potable antifreeze. Fill each tank with water mixed with one cup bleach to sanitise the tank. Let sit for several hours. Drain tank (remove sediment strainer bowl, drain into bilge, use bilge pump, replace strainer bowl)

*EVERY FILL-UP* Add a few tablespoons of baking soda, particularly if the water is heavily chlorinated. If filling from a unknown source, a half cup of bleach per tank will help kill algae or bacteria.

*IF CONTAMINATED BY ALGAE* Clean out tanks though access ports in tops of tanks. Add one cup of chlorine bleach per tank, fill with water Let sit for 6-12 hours and flush the solution through the system Periodically clean sediment strainer. Rinse thoroughly with fresh water. Follow steps above for a new tank to complete the cleaning process.

#### WATER FILTER:

Change water filter element at least once a season, or whenever flow is reduced.
