# Reverse Osmosis (RO) Water Maker

## Startup

1. Verify the seawater intake (seacock #9) is open at the through-hull.
* Switch **Sample Valve** under galley sink to right, labeled "Sink".
* Turn the **High Pressure Bypass Valve** (Stainless with Black Handle) to the OPEN POSITION. Rotate away and down. Pointy end up.
* FAILURE TO OPEN THE HIGH PRESSURE BYPASS VALVE COULD RESULT IN HYDRAULIC SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM.
* Turn on Seawater Pump boost switch at sink or on MFD under pumps. It’s controlled by CZone.
* Check that **Feed Pressure** reaches **15-30 PSI** on feed line. The boost pump takes seawater and pushes it through the 5 micron sediment filter located in the lazerette. As the filter becomes clogged the feed pressure is reduced. The boost pump also turns on an LED behind the filter to help illuminate the filter condition.
* Let run for 1-10 minutes to flush out any stinky stagnent water.
* Turn on "Pressure Pump" switch on the iPad within the WilhelmSK app or relay #1 on the Victron Venus GX remote console.
* Verify brine discharge is flowing into the sink and the sink drain is clear.
* Check that feed pressure remains above 10 PSI at all times. If it drops below it's probably time to replace pre-filter.
* Note titanium High Pressure Regulator with hex head. It is used to adjust membrane pressure. Slowly tighten screw (clockwise) atop the High Pressure Regulator to increase pressure or loosen in small increments to reduce pressure.
* Gradually turn the High Pressure Bypass Valve (Black Handle) to CLOSED position. Will be horizontal.
* **Flow Meter** should be between **5-7 GPH**. If used in fresh or brackish water reduce pressure at High Pressure Regulator as necessary to achieve correct product flow. MUST REAMIN BELOW 8 GPH AT ALL TIMES.
* High pressure **Membrane Gauge** should read between **800-850PSI** in typical salt water. MUST REMAIN BELOW 900PSI.
* Inspect all plumbing connections in the unit for leakage. Cold water temperature can cause condensation.
* Let product water run into sink for around 5 minutes. If the unit was filled with preservative storage solution, production must remain diverted AT LEAST 10 MINUTES to clear preservative solution from system.
* Check product water with hand-held TDS meter kept on the top shelf in the cabinet next to the sink.
* When PPM is below 250 in cold water and 350 in warm ensure and there is no smell or taste the quality is good.
* If quality is good, turn the Sample Valve over to the left in "Tank" direction.
* Under the sink under the floor hatch are two valves that control the tank being filled. It should be opposite of the tank being used for consumption.
* Check the RO unit for feed (10-30PSI) and membrane pressure (800-850), water leakage periodically at the initial start-up. Observe Product Flow meter (5-8GPH). Monitor inline TDS meter.

## Shutdown

1. Gradually turn the **High Pressure Bypass Valve** (Stainless with Black Handle) to the OPEN POSITION. Rotate away and down. Pointy end up. This will release the high pressure within the RO system.
2. Switch OFF "Pressure Pump" on iPad or Relay #1 on the VictronGX Remote Console.
3. The RO unit may be left in this “stand by” condition with the seawater for a maximum of 20-24 hours. If the RO unit will be out of service for more than 20 hours please refer **Storage/Flush** instructions.

## Short Term Storage (Flush)

Flushing should happen every 1-3 days.

Currently the motorized valve is controlled from relay #2 of the Venus GX. When the switch is on the valve opens, allowing freshwater from the tank to flow through the prefilter and membrane housing. The house freshwater pump must be on. Turning off the switch will close the valve. The valve takes a few seconds to open or close.

1. Freshwater flush can happen after pressure and boost pumps are off.
2. Make sure High Pressure Bypass Valve (Stainless with Black Handle) at membrane is in the open position.
3. Turn on freshwater pump. Button at sink.
4. Turn on "Freshwater Flush Valve" on iPad within WilhelmSK or "Relay 2" on VenusGX Remote Console. Water will come out the seawater spigot at the sink, and filling a glass and taking readings with the TDS meter will show decreasing levels.
5. Let run for 1-2 minutes. Run until TDS meter shows under 700 PPM.
6. (Optional) Turn Cleaning Valve (3-way grey below high pressure gauge) to the circulate position. Turn the handle counter clockwise until it sticks up. This will discharge water out the feed side of the boost pump and push it out the stainer and out the seacock. Let it run for several seconds and return valve to sink position by moving clockwise until it sticks down.
7. Turn off "Freshwater Flush Valve" or Relay 2 to close it.
8. Repeat every 1-3 days.

_Next up on the list is automatic fresh water flush._

Use Propylene glycol (no ethyl esters alcohol) for long term storage.

## Long Term Storage

1. Perform Short Term Storage Flush. Make sure seacock is open and perform step 6 above but let run for 2 minutes to purge seawater from the system and leave in the circulate position.
2. Remove the pre-filter cartridge from the pre-filter housing located below the pressure pump inside the lazarette. There is a filter housing wrench hanging on the right side of the box that holds the pressure pump.
3. Empty housing and rinse the filter and housing. If the filter looks clean spray it down and save it for reuse.
4. Replace pre-filter with Sodium metabisulfite preservative chemical (#3 or Green Stripe if using VM product).
5. Fill housing with clean, unchlorinated drinking water and re-secure the housing, with the chemical cartridge now inside.
6. Activate Freshwater Flush Valve for several seconds to remove any air that remains in the pre-filter housing after install.
7. Close seacock
8. Turn on the boost pump. This is a button labeled "Sea Water" at the sink.
9. If there is pressure for some reason it can be released by temporarily changing the position of the Cleaning Valve.
10. Let the unit run in this "re-circulate mode" for 30 minutes.
11. After 30 minutes SHUT THE PUMP OFF
12. Remove chemical cartridge from housing. Reinstall pre-filter housing back without any filter in it.
13. The R.O unit is now preserved ("pickled") and may be left unattended, with no additional operation, or flushing, for a maximum of 4 months.
14. IF the R.O. unit is to be stored for longer than 4 months the above can be repeated using new chemical after flushing out old chemical.

To return the unit to NORMAL operation and UN-PRESERVCE, place a 5 micron filter in the pre-filter housing, put the cleaning valve in the NORMAL position (discharge to sink), open the raw water inlet sea cock, start the unit's low pressure pump and let unit run for 10 minutes with everything flushing down the sink. Next, start the unit's high-pressure pump. Then slowly bring the high pressure up to 800 psi. Let the unit run in this normal state for 30 minutes, with the product flow flushing down the sink. Then double check TDS meter and switch to tank if desired.

## Cleaning

Use the alaki first at 50 grams per 4.5 litres water, circulate for 1/2 hour, stop circulation and let it soak for 1 hour, circulate for another 1/2 hour then flush out. Fill with acid at same dilution as alkali, circulate for 45 min - 1 hour then flush. Do not use soak for the acid.
