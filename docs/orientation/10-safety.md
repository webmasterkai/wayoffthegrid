SAFETY SHOULD BE THE FIRST CONCERN OF EVERY SAILOR, AND CERTAIN ITEMS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE CARRIED ON THE YACHT. MINIMUM SAFETY EQUIPMENT REGULATIONS VARY AS TO THE JURISDICTION UNDER WHICH THE YACHT MAY BE OPERATING. YOU MUST CARRY THE MINIMUM EQUIPMENT REQUIRED BY THE REGULATIONS OF THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY UNDER WHICH YOUR YACHT IS REGISTERED OR FACE SEVERE LEGAL PENALTIES. HOWEVER, PRUDENT PRACTICE DICTATES THAT YOU EQUIP THE YACHT TO A MUCH HIGHER STANDARD THAN THE MINIMUM REQUIRED BY LAW. ADDITIONAL SAFETY EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE NATURE OF YOUR CRUISING AREA(S), WEATHER CONDITIONS AND ALL NAVIGATIONAL RISKS AND HAZARDS - EXPECTED OR UNEXPECTED.

### 10-2 Additional Equipment Recommendations

The International Sailing Federation Offshore Racing Council's SPECIAL REGULATIONS governing offshore racing are a good starting point forguidelines as to equipping your yacht. For offshore cruising, a yacht should be
equipped to Category One requirements as a minimum standard. This publication may be purchased from your national sailing association.
Life Jackets (PFDs)  The wearing of a PFD by competent swimmers in benign conditions should {
never be considered "sissy-fied" and is highly recommended at all times when
underway. Non-swimmers should always wear a PFD at anytime on deck, even  at the dock. It is prudent practice to attach a whistle and small personal strobe light to each wearable PFD. For sailors who feel that the traditional bulky life
jacket will hinder their movement about the boat, inflatable PFDs are now on the  market, while CG approved models are preferred, other models will still provide . I
more safety than wearing no flotation.
In addition, an approved "throwable device" is usually required to be carried ? near the helmsman or on deck. Many very effective "man-overboard devices"
are NOT USCG approved. Make sure you have an approved device in addition 1 to the non-approved but desirable device. '
Life Buoys
PS
Many yachts carry life buoys or "man-overboard poles" which can be stowed in a * bracket on the stern or adjacent to the helmsman. These life buoys should have
a gravity-activated strobe or other bright light attached, along with a long line which connects to a man-overboard pole. This pole is typically stored near the
transom and would go overboard along with the buoy and light. The assembly m facilitates spotting the person to whom the buoy has been launched in any type
of sea or visibility conditions.
Safety Harnesses Just as with life jackets, a safety harness should always be worn by crew
members on deck in all but the calmest conditions. Harnesses allow the wearer to be attached to some permanent fixture on or above the deck. They should be ! of good quality and capable of carrying the full weight of the wearer falling
several feet. There are padeyes mounted in the cockpit and on deck specifically m> for this purpose. Additionally, removable nylon web strap jacklines are supplied with your SAGA which will allow the crew to manoeuvre on deck without
detaching the harness tether line. CAUTION: Nylon degrades when exposed to T UV light over a period of time. Be sure to remove the jacklines between '
passages or whenever the jacklines are not being used. Inspect them regularly
and replace the web straps if any sign of degradation is observed. nq
 $PFlashlights
The yacht should be equipped with several water-proof flashlights, routinely
checked to be in good condition with well charged batteries. Flashlights serve as a convenience at night while moving about the yacht and in trimming sails as
well as a safety measure. They may also be used for attracting attention as well as locating a person overboard.
Radar Reflectors
The fiberglass sailboat may not create a distinctive return on another vessel's
radar, therefore a radar reflector is a must. The radar reflector should be stored

0 carefully to prevent damage as the performance of the unit is directly related to the accuracy of the intersecting angles of the component planes. When
mounted, the reflector should be carried as high as possible on your boat. Often, a flag halyard is used to hold a reflector just below one of the spreaders. Some
types of reflectors may be mounted permanently on the mast or one of the stays.
Dinghy or Life Raft
Your yacht has a locker intended for a valise-type life raft on the starboard side
of the cockpit. Most modern 6 person life rafts will fit in the locker; however, be sure the one you contemplate buying will fit before spending your money.
The modern inflatable dinghy is a great convenience while cruising, but is of
limited use in an emergency situation. Inflatable craft should be thoroughly
checked every year to ensure safe and proper operation. Life rafts should be
inflated, inspected, repacked and certified on a regular basis. Your SAGA Yachts Dealer can advise you where such inspections are offered in your locale.

### 10-3 Lifelines

The life lines aboard your yacht should be checked daily to ensure their integrity. Always close the access gates before leaving the dock. On longer offshore passages, the gates' pelican hooks are best taped over to prevent
accidental opening. Check carefully that the swage end fittings are not pulling out and that the lock nuts on the turnbuckles are tight. Cotter pins (not "ring-
dings") should be fitted and taped over for protection from chafe and personal
injury. Do Not allow crew members to sit on the lifelines as it damages the wires where they pass through the stanchions.
10-4 Anchors & Anchoring
Your yacht is equipped with two large anchor handling rollers on the bowsprit and a large, divided, rope/chain locker low in the forepeak. Since all of the factory supplied components are generously-sized, it is tempting to overload the bow. In a quest for a high confidence level when anchored. Many sailors ignore the negative effects of an overloaded bow on the flotation level and trim of the yacht; this in turn has an adverse effect on performance, comfort, and even safety when one encounters heavy weather.


There are several strategies to use to reduce the overall weight of your '
anchoring system and increase its efficiency for certain conditions. The following
list of equipment may not be entirely suitable for your cruising style or locale. T
1. Use only modern lightweight anchors with high 'Holding Power to Weight'
ratios. Some of the new aluminum lightweights are especially effective in 1 sand and mud bottom conditions.
2. Use high-tensile chain of a size or two smaller than that required of BBB or
proof coil chain. Tests show that modern burying type anchors can actually dig deeper into the sea bottom with a smaller diameter HT chain thereby
increasing holding power of the overall system. Avoid the "belt and i+
suspenders" temptation of using the same size HT chain as you would for BBB. The system is only as strong as its weakest link, which will usually be
the holding power of the anchor itself. 5/16" HT chain has a working load
twice that of 5/16" BBB and a third greater than 3/8" BBB. In fact 1/4" HT chain has a working load roughly equal to 3/8" BBB.
3. Store the "storm anchor" which will be rarely used, aft and low under the
cockpit. Your back will appreciate two smaller anchors forward. ! 4. Avoid full chain rodes. 10-15 fathoms of chain on your primary anchor
should suffice for chafe protection on coral or rocky bottoms. The elasticity of  a nylon rode is beneficial as it tends to prevent jerking the anchor out in a '
heavy surge. Nylon is much quieter and much easier on the hands. A nylon
rode will reset easier than all-chain after a major wind shift. Nylon is also more environmentally friendly to coral and sub-aquatic vegetation. ' 5. Practice technique. Anchoring is a learned skill. No amount of chain or
anchors aboard your yacht will substitute for poor anchoring technique. The following anchor combination weighs in at under 225 lbs. It may not be
entirely appropriate for your conditions. The type and quantity of anchors you i,
ultimately choose will vary from region to region according to the sea bottom and
local conditions. Each anchor should include an adequate size and length of line
along with a length of chain to ensure that the anchor lies properly and penetrates the bottom as well as protecting the line from chafe on the seabed.
35 lb. plow (Bruce, CQR, or Delta) & 30 ft. of 1/4" HT Chain spliced to 200 ft. i 9/16" Nylon, (substituting a Danforth 20H or Fortress FX23 may increase
holding power and versatility on muddy bottoms and reduce overall weight  about 15 lbs.) 45 lb. plow (Bruce, CQR or Delta) & 60 ft. of 5/16" HT Chain spliced to 200 ft.
5/8" Nylon.
An electric windlass which handles a specially spliced rope/chain rode is
optional. Make sure your windlass gypsy and the anchor rode and chain are
correctly matched to each other and a proper splice connects them, for smooth <-, operation.
After the anchor is laid out with sufficient scope for the depth of water, cleat the anchor rode and back down on the anchor with the engine at approximately 2000 RPM in reverse. Watch for dragging. If you drag, retrieve the anchor and
try again.
There is no agreement in boating on any single anchoring technique or
anchoring equipment. Although we offer one possible combination of anchoring
equipment, other sources may provide you with differing recommendations. Talk to other boat owners in your area, take courses with the Power Squadron, Coast
Guard Auxiliary or an accredited sailing school
10-5 Gasoline Storage
Gasoline vapours are explosive in the right concentrations and heavier than air.
Improper storage of the dinghy's outboard gasoline supply is extremely hazardous. We have provided a special locker in the cockpit near the transom
door designed to hold a standard 6 gal outboard tank. The locker is vented
overboard and sealed from the bilge according to USCG guidelines. This is a p unique SAGA feature. Please use it for your safety.
NEVER STORE GASOLINE IN A SAIL LOCKER OR BELOW DECKS
