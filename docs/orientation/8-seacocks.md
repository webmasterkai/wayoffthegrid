## Maintenance

Each factory installed seacock is made from a material which allows the valve to be free of corrosion and electrolysis. They require no electrical "bonding".

These valves still require regular inspection and lubrication. Inspect hose clamps carefully. Any rusted clamps should be replaced immediately. All hoses should be fitted with two clamps for redundancy. Activate the handle and lubricate the seals at least twice yearly. A quality waterproof grease or vegetable oil can be used as a lubricant.

### Through Hull Installation - AFTERMARKET

Each factory installed seacock or through hull is installed in an area where the core material has been removed to prevent the incursion of water into the core. Before installing any additional through hulls, the core must be removed in that area and the area sealed and locally reinforced with additional layers of fiberglass and/or backing plates. We recommend that a skilled professional experienced with cored hull construction install any desired additional through hulls.
