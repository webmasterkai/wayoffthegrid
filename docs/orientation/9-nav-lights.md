# Navigation Lights

The Navigation lights are controlled by breakers on the Main Panel. The lights you show other craft signify your legal status and affect your right of way rights. Learn what each of the lights means as well as the many light configurations on various other types of craft. A sliderule is kept in the chart table to help identify lights seen at night.

The compass light has a separate cockpit mounted switch in addition to the panel breaker to switch on when desired.
Carry spare light bulbs. Always check navigation lights before leaving the dock or mooring, even if you do not expect to stay out after dusk. You may be unexpectedly delayed.

Refer to USCG Publication #CG-169 RULES OF THE ROAD (COLREGS) for more information on lights and navigation rules.

## Engine In Gear

Any time the engine is propelling the vessel, even if sails are raised and drawing. If you are running the engine in neutral for battery charging the following does not apply.

1. Turn on "NAVIGATION LIGHTS" breaker. Red and Green sidelights (on bow rail) along with a white stern light (on stern rail) will illuminate.
2. Turn on "STEAMING LIGHT". White light on forward face of mast. Although located at half height, legally designated the "masthead" light.

## Sailing

When operating as a sailboat only, you may choose to use the combination Tri-Color light (Red, Green, and White) at the masthead OR the deck-level navigation lights. Even though located on the top of the mast, the Tri-Color is not the "masthead" light. DO NOT USE the Tri-Color light simultaneously with any other navigation lights or whenever operating propulsion machinery.

1. Turn off "STEAMING LIGHT"
1. Turn off "NAVIGATION LIGHTS"
1. Turn on "TRI LIGHT". If there is a lot of traffic in close proximity we switch off TRI and turn on NAVIGATION.
