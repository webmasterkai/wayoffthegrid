# Distress Calls

## Status Codewords

* **MAYDAY:** IMMEDIATE threat or grave danger to life or property.  
* **PAN:** Man overboard or other urgent circumstance or emergency.  
* **Sécurité:** Safety information.

### Before talking

The VHF and SSB are both equipped with a distress button. Lift the distress cover and push the button underneath for 5 seconds or until the radio gives directions. An automated distress signal is sent, broadcasting our MMSI number and position.

When the Coast Guard receives your DSC distress call, the watchstander on duty is alerted, the Coast Guard’s DSC signals your radio to switch to Channel 16, your radio announces receipt of the Coast Guard’s signal, and the Coast Guard establishes voice communication with you.

* Firmly push the large PTT button on the left side of the microphone.
* Remember to speak slowly and clearly.
* Press and hold distress button for 5 seconds.
* Put radio on "High" power. 25w on fixed units or 6 Watts on the handheld.
* **VHF** radio is on **Chanel 16**.
